<p>It’s normal to feel a lack of motivation after losing a loved one, and sorting through their belongings can seem like a daunting task while you’re grieving. Perhaps you’re unsure what to do with everything or how quickly you need to get it done. We’ve put together some suggestions to help you decide what to do with the rest of someone’s belongings after they die.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remember that your loved one may have left some of their belongings to named people in their will, and you are legally obliged to carry out their wishes. You might also need to consider other family members when deciding what to do with the belongings not mentioned in the will.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Packing up the house</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Packing up the house after losing a loved one can be both physically and emotionally demanding. Most people have accrued many items throughout their lifetime, and sorting through them can be quite a big job. You might want to emotionally prepare to discover sentimental items and relive memories of time spent with the person who has died. It can help to ask other family members to accompany you for support, or you might prefer to look through meaningful possessions alone before asking for help with furniture and general belongings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is no time limit on when you have to pack up the house, so if it feels too much, delay it until you feel ready. Just remember to check whether there are any financial implications of waiting, such as ongoing mortgage repayments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you have gone through your loved one’s belongings, you can decide what to do with the items. Here are some of our suggestions:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Sharing possessions with family</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You are likely to come across many items that have sentimental value rather than monetary value, and you can discuss who will keep which items with your family members. This process can be a lovely way to hear about each other’s memories with the person who has died, and you’ll often find that items have a different meaning for each person.<br /><br />If you need help deciding how to share out items, everyone in the family can have a pack of stickers and can stick them onto the items they’d like to keep as they go round the house. You can then discuss any overlaps and come to a decision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When sharing out items with monetary value, some families allocate an equal ‘allowance’ to each person and place a price or value on each item, which they then ‘bid’ on. This works best when family members get on well and can keep it lighthearted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Donating items to charity</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After sorting through your loved one’s belongings, you’ll probably have plenty of things you could donate to charity. Choosing a charity that meant something to your loved one can be a nice way to <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/remembering-a-loved-one/">honour their memory</a>. Or, you might want to support organisations that helped care for your family member in some way, such as a local hospice or Age UK.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before taking your donations to the charity shop, find out which items they will or won’t accept. For safety reasons, many charity shops won’t accept electrical goods and will only accept furniture with fire safety labels still attached (If you do have electrical goods, Cancer Research UK is one of the few charities that will take them, but they don’t accept white goods).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Charities say that they appreciate clothing, accessories, homeware, linen and books, as they sell particularly well. Some charities will come to collect larger items, such as wardrobes and beds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another option is to sell items, then donate the money you raise to the charity as a cash donation (they can also claim gift aid if you’re a taxpayer).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Selling items</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You may have items that are in a good, saleable condition that you decide to sell; this could be anything from large furniture, like wardrobes and dressers, to smaller items like clothing or crockery. eBay and local social media selling sites can be good places to list items for sale. For smaller, less valuable items, you might decide to hold a car boot sale.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you have sorted through their possessions, you need to decide what to do with their house. You need to check whether they owned the house outright or if there is an outstanding mortgage to pay to the bank. After this, you might decide to keep their house, to either live in, rent out or sell. We’d recommend taking advice from a solicitor. before making a decision, particularly if family members disagree on the best option.</p>

		Returning to work after a bereavement

		<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Returning to work after a bereavement can be really tough. Here are some tips around taking time off after a loss, and ideas to help you settle back into working life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Your first day back at work</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you feel ready to return to work, talk to your employer about how they can make it as easy as possible for you. Going in for a coffee or lunch with your manager and/or colleagues before your first day back can help to get the potentially uncomfortable conversations out of the way. Discuss how others can support you, and how you would like difficult moments at work to be managed. For example, would you prefer to be left alone if you get upset, or would you want company? Ask your manager or HR representative for regular catch ups and check-ins to help you settle back in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>When should I go back to work?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are no set rules for when you should go <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/bereavement-leave/">back to work after a bereavement</a>; it will depend on a lot of personal factors, as well as the rules that your employer sets out for bereavement leave. Work may offer a welcome distraction from your grief, but it can also seem very overwhelming. Make sure that you have an honest conversation with your employer about how you’re feeling, and how they can best support you with your return to work.  <br />If you are struggling to cope with bereavement at any point, see your GP. Feeling depressed and anxious after a loss could count as illness, which entitles you to statutory or occupational sick pay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Set your own boundaries</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it’s time to go back to work after a bereavement, think through what you need your colleagues and employer to do to support you:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Do you feel fit to work full time or would you prefer a phased return (i.e. working half days to start with)?</li>
<li>How do you want others to treat you – would you like your colleagues to express their condolences and ask how you are? Or would you prefer them not to mention your loss, or not to know about it at all? It is completely up to you how much you choose to share with others.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Keep up a routine</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sticking to a regular daily routine, including exercise and regular meals before, during and after work, can really benefit your mental health and give your days some structure while you’re coping with bereavement. Grief can have a huge impact on your ability to concentrate, so having a to-do list that breaks down different tasks at work (and at home) can give you a sense of focus and help you feel more in control as you ease yourself slowly back to work. Asking a close colleague to check any important work could also be helpful - remember it is totally normal at the start for the quality of your work and the amount you can get done in a day to have decreased since your loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Looking after yourself</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Going back to work after a bereavement can feel overwhelming, so thinking through potential coping strategies can help in case it all suddenly feels too much.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>If you get upset, is there a room you can retreat to, or a kind colleague you can talk to?</li>
<li>What can you do to avoid getting stressed? For example, block off time in your diary every day to take a break, go for a walk, have lunch, stretch, switch off for a bit</li>
<li>Think up some standard responses to questions such as: ‘How are you doing?’. That way you won’t be caught off guard and can move the conversation on swiftly if you don’t want to talk about it</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With all this in mind, you can feel prepared and ready for your first day back at work after bereavement.</p>

		Bereavement Leave
		https://untanglegrief.com/bereavement-leave/
		Tue, 03 Aug 2021 08:34:14 +0000
		creativebrains01
		https://untanglegrief.com/?p=81
		
		<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After experiencing the loss of a loved one, knowing what to expect from your employer can help relieve some of the pressure around returning to work. In this article, we’ve outlined what to expect from your employer, bereavement leave law, and how your workplace can support you after a loss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Am I entitled to workplace support?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the UK, employers are not legally obliged to offer paid bereavement leave, but many do. Most are very understanding in the event of bereavement and will do their best to support you in any way they can. Your workplace may have a Bereavement Policy that outlines your entitlement to bereavement leave, pay and ongoing support.<br />There is no set number of days that an employer must offer for bereavement leave, but they are obliged to allow a ‘reasonable’ number of days as unpaid leave.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Typically, employers in the UK allow 3-5 days bereavement leave for the loss of a close family member, like a spouse, parent, or sibling; less for other relatives, such as grandparents, aunts, and uncles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have experienced a stillbirth or the loss of a child, you are legally entitled to two weeks’ Parental Bereavement Leave with Statutory Parental Bereavement Pay. Your employer may choose to provide additional child bereavement support and top up this payment to replace your full wage during this two week period. You can read more at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/time-off-for-dependants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gov.uk</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People need different amounts of time to process their loss enough to return to work. If you feel that you need longer than allocated, you can discuss extending your bereavement leave with your HR department or manager, or using holiday leave to give yourself some extra time. If this isn’t an option, your GP may be able to support you in taking time off as sick leave until you <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/returning-to-work-after-a-bereavement/">feel able to return.</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How can my workplace support me after a loss?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you inform your workplace of your bereavement, a good manager will offer their condolences and reassure you that taking the time to grieve takes priority over work. You can use this initial conversation to ask if they have a Bereavement Policy for you to read through to get a clear idea of how you can expect to be supported.<br />Depending on the nature of your work, your manager might ask if there is anything they need to do in your absence. They may also offer to tell your colleagues about your loss, so you don’t have to explain it again when you return. Your employer shouldn’t make you feel guilty about taking time off or try to rush you back to work before you’re ready.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you do return to work after bereavement leave, you may find that you struggle to concentrate or are not able to manage your full duties straight away. Your manager should support you as you settle back into the workplace, including discussing whether a phased return is an option if you feel it may help.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your workplace might also offer a counselling service that offers bereavement counselling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Advice from our community</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We asked some of our current members of our community to share their stories about how they dealt with returning to work while coping with grief after a bereavement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tsungai - "My advice would be - speak. Say what you need and ask for a day off when you need to and if that’s not possible take a break and do whatever you need to do to be okay."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Shannon - "If you’re like me and work doesn’t provide a distraction, my advice would be to communicate your needs as best you can from the start. You might need a gradual return to ease yourself back in. My workplace was very sympathetic and accommodating with helping me until I gained some focus back."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Melanie - "I was very fortunate, my employer encouraged me to take as long as I needed before returning to work. Work is my sanctuary and I find it a really good way to cope. I was lucky to manage a new team of people who don’t know what has happened to me. As long as I keep busy I can generally keep the grief at bay."</p>

<p>This article outlines what to expect when registering a death in England and Wales</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When a person dies, a doctor will verify their death and issue a certificate stating the cause of death. Once you receive the death certificate, you must officially register the death with a registrar within 5 days, including weekends and bank holidays. If the death is referred to a coroner, you have to wait for their permission before registering the death, even if this takes longer than five days. If the person died abroad, the death must be registered in the country in which it happened and in the UK.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How to register a death</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A registrar office is a government building where officials register births, marriages and deaths. In England and Wales, you can register a death at any registrar office, but it is usually more straight forward if you use the one closest to where the person died. You should receive the contact details of the nearest registrar office when you receive the death certificate from a GP or hospital doctor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s best to contact the registrar office as soon as possible, as you will usually need to book an appointment to attend. You can book by telephone or complete an online form which you access through your local authority website. Appointments typically last for around 30 minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Who can register a death?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A death should be registered by a relative, anyone present at the death, an owner or occupier of the building in which the death happened (hospital staff, for instance), or someone arranging the funeral who knew the person who died.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How much does it cost to register a death?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You do not have to pay to register a death, but you will need to pay for any additional copies of the death certificate required to settle the person’s affairs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Important information</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you register a death, the registrar will give you two documents. The first is a Certificate for Burial or Cremation (known as the ‘green form’), which gives permission for burial, or for you to apply for a cremation. You give this form to your appointed funeral director so that they can legally plan the funeral. The second is the Certificate of Registration of Death (form BD8), which you may need to fill in and return if the person was getting a State Pension or benefits (the form will come with a pre-paid return envelope). Your registrar should also give you a unique number to use for the Tell Us Once service that informs all government departments of the death. If you wish to hold a burial within 24 hours for cultural or religious reasons, contact your registrar for advice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We recommend getting 8-10 copies of the death certificate, as you will need to provide evidence of the death to various companies and organisations, <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/notifying-banks-death-notification-service/">including banks</a> and <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/notifying-insurance-companies-of-a-death/">insurance companies</a>. You also need a death certificate to appoint a <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/applying-for-grant-of-probate/">Grant of Probate</a> to execute the will.</p>

<p><strong>One of the most challenging parts of <a href="/our-advice-for-planning-a-funeral/">funeral planning</a> is writing a fitting tribute to your loved one.</strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How can you find the words to capture just how much your friend or family member means to you? It’s harder still because you’re grieving, so emotions are running high, concentration is low, and the pressure may be overwhelming. <strong>That’s why we’ve created this guide on how to write a eulogy, complete with examples to get you started.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2 class="has-text-align-left has-large-font-size"><strong>What is a eulogy?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>A eulogy is a short speech given at a funeral or <a href="/how-to-memorial-ceremony/">memorial service</a> for a person who has died. </strong>The tradition originates from ancient Greece, and the word literally means “praise”. The key is to write the eulogy in a way that does their life justice and respects their loved ones’ memories and feelings of grief.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"left","fontSize":"large"} -->
<h2 class="has-text-align-left has-large-font-size"><strong>Who should deliver a eulogy?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking about someone who has died in front of their family and friends is a courageous thing to do. If you feel daunted by the prospect, ask people around you for support. <strong>While a close relative or friend usually writes the funeral speech, it can also be delivered by an official, such as a religious leader.</strong> Do what feels right and keep it flexible. For example, if you want to write the eulogy but worry about <a href="/preparing-yourself-for-the-funeral/">breaking down in tears</a>, ask someone else to be on standby to read it for you if need be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator {"style":{"color":{"background":"#e8e8e8"}},"className":"is-style-wide"} -->

<h2 class="has-text-align-left has-large-font-size" id="tips"><strong>How to write a eulogy - 6 tips</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>1. Make it personal</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Introducing yourself in relation to the person you are remembering can be a good place to start.</strong> Describe what they meant to you, and what qualities defined them in your eyes. This will establish a connection with other people at the service and put you in the picture for those who might not know you very well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>2. Cover the essentials</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When thinking about how to write a eulogy, it’s a good idea to structure it with a beginning, a middle and an end. And while it is not the same as an obituary, <strong>it usually includes brief aspects of the late person’s life, such as their early beginnings, their education and career, and particular skills, achievements or interests.</strong> Saying something specific about their family life, and mentioning their partner and/or children by name, can feel particularly important to their closest relatives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>3. Get personal stories from others</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just like our relationships with a particular person differ, so do our <a href="/stages-of-grief/">feelings about them when they die</a>. To make sure you write a good eulogy that will feel meaningful to others, <strong>ask a few close friends or relatives to contribute by sharing a favourite memory, personal story, or anecdote</strong>. A range of perspectives will enrich your speech and help strike the right tone right with your audience. You might also discover a true gem in the process, like a beautiful quote that perfectly captures your loved one’s personality, qualities, and quirks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>4. Consider the length</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How long should a eulogy be?<strong> Some funeral speeches are very brief and there are no set rules for length, but 3-5 minutes is common.</strong> Make it long enough to properly honour the person and say what needs to be said, in proportion to the rest of the funeral service. To get it right, try reading it out loud a few times while timing yourself and editing accordingly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>5. Make it honest</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is possible to talk about someone’s achievements and qualities without glorifying them and mention shortcomings or disappointments in a kind and accepting way. None of us are perfect, and we remember those we have lost in all their human complexity. <strong>Follow your instincts, even using some gentle humour if it feels right and relevant.</strong> And if you’re not sure, ask someone else for their honest feedback before you finalise your eulogy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>6. End on a touching note</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ending a eulogy on the right note can be tricky. <strong>One option is to finish with a poem or <a href="/the-35-greatest-grief-quotes/">quote</a> that feels consoling and meaningful, even if it happens to come from a movie such as <em>Pretty Woman</em> or <em>Lord of the Rings</em>!</strong> You might find inspiration in famous eulogies, such as Matthew’s tribute to his partner Gareth in <em>Four Weddings and a Funeral</em>, Oprah Winfrey’s speech for Rosa Parks, Mona Simpson remembering her brother Steve Jobs, or in books and online quote collections.</p>

When she was 21, she signed up for the marathon because she’d seen some running shoes she liked – and, of course, she smashed it. When she was 26, she went to the dog shelter ‘just to take a look’, and came home with two pups, Charlie and Bubbles, who adored her.&nbsp;</em></p>

		<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There is no escaping the fact that the funeral will be hard, but finding ways to alleviate your nerves and process your thoughts and feelings can help you feel ready to face it. We want to share a few ways you can emotionally prepare yourself in the run up to a funeral.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Be kind to yourself</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The lead up to a funeral is often a particularly stressful and upsetting part of the grieving process. The <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/our-advice-for-planning-a-funeral/">practical aspects of funeral preparation</a> and the worry about how you’ll feel on the day can be overwhelming while you’re coping with grief. It’s completely natural to feel apprehensive about attending a funeral. If you had a close relationship with the person who has died, you might have intense waves of grief that can sometimes be quite overwhelming. Worrying about how you’ll manage your feelings and whether you’ll ‘hold it together’ on the day of the funeral can bring added pressure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be kind to yourself and don’t expect too much. It’s normal to cry and express sadness at a funeral, and no one will expect you to hold it all in. You might find it comforting to share your grief and memories of the person who has died with other mourners. In a recent survey, our community members said that hearing other people’s stories about the deceased was one of the things they like most about funerals. It’s also important to know that there is no ‘right way’ to grieve. You might feel numb at times, and that can be a normal part of the grieving process, too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Accept offers to help</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a loss, the people around you will often pull together to support you in any way they can. This could be with practical help, such as taking responsibility for part of the funeral preparation, or by simply being there for you as a listening ear and a shoulder to cry on. Accepting offers of help can give you the time and headspace to process your thoughts and focus on emotionally preparing for the funeral.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Along with offers of support from family and friends, you might find that some colleagues, neighbours and acquaintances also want to help with funeral preparations. Don’t worry about bothering someone or being a nuisance - people are offering help because they want to be there for you. Contributing to the funeral in some way may also help them in their grieving process. Often, people want to help but don’t know how. They may well be grateful to be given specific things to do. Read <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/our-advice-for-planning-a-funeral/">our advice for planning a funeral</a> for some suggestions of which tasks you can delegate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you look back at this time, it can be comforting to remember the people around you who reached out and were there to support you when you needed them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Don’t numb your feelings</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Waves of grief can be uncomfortable and intense, but dealing with them as they come, rather than pushing them away, can help the grieving process in the long run. Burying your emotions can impact your mental and physical health over time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Try to resist numbing your feelings with alcohol or drugs. Unhealthy or harmful coping mechanisms only mask your feelings and will very likely make you feel worse. If you’re struggling to process your feelings around your loss, you might want to consider <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/events/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><u>bereavement counselling</u></strong></a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Consider joining a support group</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you think you may find comfort from meeting other people going through a similar experience to you, <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/events/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><u>we host in-person and online grieving groups</u></strong></a> that bring together people who are coping with loss. These can be particularly helpful for people who have experienced an unexpected, complex, or traumatic bereavement, such as losing a child. Some grief groups are run by counsellors, therapists, or other professionals who can offer specialist bereavement support.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Take advice from the funeral director</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You might feel that fear of the unknown is one of the most upsetting parts of preparing for a funeral. What will happen on the day? What if something goes wrong? What if I go to pieces?<br />This is where a good funeral director is invaluable. Most good funeral directors will walk you through the steps and timings of the day, so you know what to expect. They work hard behind the scenes to make sure the day runs smoothly, so you can focus on saying goodbye to your loved one. You can find a funeral director through our funeral booking service.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Preparation is key</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When attending a funeral, the little things can become big things if you leave them until the last minute. It’s best to be organised and ready, so you don’t have any decisions to make or jobs to do on the day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Choose your outfit and make sure it’s ready to wear</li>
<li>Plan what you’ll have for breakfast</li>
<li>Delegate tasks to family and friends so you don’t have to remember anything on the day</li>
<li>Double check with the funeral director that nothing is outstanding</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being organised can help to relieve nerves and will prevent any last-minute panic on the day. If you plan to read<a href="https://untanglegrief.com/how-to-write-a-eulogy/"> a eulogy</a> or reading at the service, it can be a good idea to practice at home beforehand. You may become emotional when reading some parts, and it can be good to get some of this emotion out at home. You might still get upset when speaking on the day, and that’s ok; don’t put pressure on yourself to hold it all in.</p>

		<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the early days and weeks after a bereavement, the process of planning a funeral can feel quite overwhelming. There can be difficult decisions to make, including honouring the wishes of the person who has died, which type of funeral service to choose, and whether to opt for burial or cremation. It can help you know what to expect, so you can make decisions that are right for you and your family.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What are my options for planning a funeral?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You will have a choice between a religious or non-religious funeral service. Anyone can legally conduct a funeral or memorial service, although a member of the clergy will usually officiate a religious ceremony, and a civil celebrant will usually officiate a non-religious ceremony (also known as a humanist ceremony).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The funeral service is followed by either a burial or cremation. Often, the person who has died will have expressed a preference for one or the other when they were alive. If not, you may wish to abide by certain religious beliefs and cultural values to help you decide.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have a special place where you would prefer to remember your loved one, that may influence your decision on whether to choose a burial or cremation. With a burial, there is a grave to visit and maintain. After a cremation, the <a href="/scattering-ashes/">ashes</a> are returned to the family for them to keep at home or scatter at a meaningful location.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What happens at a burial?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the funeral service, the mourners will assemble at the graveside for the burial. The grave will be prepared and ready before you arrive. A short ceremony takes place, usually led by a religious leader or celebrant. It can involve readings and prayers at the graveside. When the time comes, the casket or coffin is lowered into the ground by nominated family bearers or funeral directors. Mourners are invited to throw flowers or scatter soil onto the coffin as a final goodbye. Some people might choose to stay at the graveside for quiet reflection after the ceremony.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What happens at a cremation?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A cremation is held at a designated crematorium. Sometimes the funeral service itself is held in the crematorium, or it can take place in a religious venue. You will arrive at the crematorium at your designated time slot, and as the service starts, sometimes you will follow behind the coffin to enter the chapel and take a seat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The moment of taking the body away for cremation is called the committal. You will be asked beforehand whether you prefer curtains to be left open, or to close in front of the coffin as it is committed. Once the coffin is taken out of view, mourners are invited to view the flowers left in memory of the person who has died before going to attend a reception or gathering.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What can I expect when planning a funeral?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As you are in the very early days and weeks of coping with grief, <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/preparing-yourself-for-the-funeral/">it’s normal to feel apprehensive and overwhelmed</a> at the thought of planning the funeral. Go easy on yourself during this time and spend some time preparing yourself emotionally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your chosen funeral director can guide and support you throughout the funeral planning, including advising of the options available within your budget. They can help make sure all the necessary paperwork is completed, provide appropriate transport to and from the funeral, arrange music for the ceremony, recommend and liaise with a florist, and much more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following a bereavement, the stress of planning a funeral can sometimes cause conflict between family members. It can help to resolve tensions by thinking about what the person who has died would have wanted and following any instructions in the Will. You could also get an impartial opinion from your funeral director, who will have experience in supporting grieving relatives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What else do I need to know?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The estate of the deceased can cover the costs of the funeral. The person responsible for the estate administration (usually named in the Will) will have access to the funds once probate has been completed, a process that can take several months.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A funeral service is usually held within 2-3 weeks of death in the UK, but there can be some delay if a coroner’s inquest or post-mortem is ordered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How can I give my loved one the best send-off?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Funerals can bring together distant relatives or friends not seen for years, and in some ways, it can be comforting to know that you have all come together for the same reason: to celebrate the life of the person you loved.<br><br>You can personalise the funeral service to reflect the tastes and personality of the person who has died. Maybe you could arrange for their favourite song to play or ask mourners to wear a bright colour instead of black.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The <a href="/funeral-wake/" data-type="post">wake</a> is an opportunity to celebrate the life of the person who has died; to raise a toast to them and share memories and stories. Some people like to display photographs around the venue or arrange a video slideshow of happy memories. You can plan the wake in any way you choose, and after the heaviness of the day, people are often ready to give the person who has died a good send-off.</p>

		How to notify utility companies of a bereavement
		https://untanglegrief.com/notifying-utility-companies-of-a-death/
		Tue, 10 Aug 2021 14:33:28 +0000
		creativebrains01
		https://untanglegrief.com/?p=195
		
		<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center","style":{"color":{"background":"#fbe0c3","text":"#003946"}}} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#fbe0c3;color:#003946">To connect with others who share a similar experience of loss, as well as access to step-by-step guides for navigating death admin, <a href="https://onelink.to/zka2sa">download the Untangle app</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Notifying all the utility companies that your loved one held accounts with can be quite a long process.  It might help to go through their documents and list all of the utilities you find letters from. For example, most people hold the following accounts: water, electricity and/or gas, phone, broadband, television packages, and subscription services.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most providers have a designated bereavement support customer service team who should explain the next steps to you once you’ve reported the death.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Who can do this?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In most cases, the utility companies will need to speak to the <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/wills-and-probate/">executor of a will</a> or the next-of-kin/administrator if your loved one died without leaving a will.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>When to do this?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ideally, notifying utility companies should happen within the first few months of your loved one’s death, once you have a death certificate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What you will need:</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Your loved one’s personal details - name, address, date of birth</li><li>A copy of the death certificate</li><li>The account number</li><li>Up to date meter readings (if applicable)</li><li>In some cases, a grant of probate or letter of administration showing that you are allowed to make changes to the account - although you can make the initial contact with a company before either is granted</li><li>Your contact details and a proof of identification/address</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Step 1 - Decide what to do with each account</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>If the account is solely in the deceased's name and you want to continue the policy:</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You will need to ask the utility company if you can change the lead name on the account. Occasionally, the company might ask you to create a new account in a new name depending upon its policy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>If the bills were paid from your joint bank account:</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Your account will continue as normal as long as the joint payment bank account remains open.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>If you want to cancel the account:</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Each provider has its own cancellation policies. In most cases, you will need to pay any outstanding balance or pay up until the end of a contract. If you are planning to sell the person’s property, we recommend keeping the utilities active (gas, water, electricity) and changing the account details into your own name.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>If the account is in both your name and theirs:</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You might decide to take their name off the utilities account but this can be done at a later date.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>If the payment comes from the deceased's account:</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>f you have already notified the bank of the death, your loved one’s bank account will probably be frozen. Therefore, you’ll need to contact the utilities company and arrange for payments to come from your account, to avoid any late payment fees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Step 2 - Contacting the companies</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gather the information above and contact each utility company in turn to notify them of the death. Some have online forms you can use to make the process faster, but you can also contact them via telephone if you prefer.<br>The utility provider should then guide you through the next steps and tell you if they need any further details or documentation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Our advice for notifying utility companies</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Make sure you have your own personal details to hand if you are contacting the company over the phone</li><li>Think about what you would like to do with the policy ahead of the call</li><li>If you want to keep the account but face a charge to create a new account in your name, you may decide to shop around for different providers</li><li>Have a pen and paper to hand to note down details and any important timeframes. Don’t be afraid to ask the company to confirm any changes or closing of accounts in writing</li></ul>

		How to notify insurance companies of a bereavement

<h3>Life, car and home insurance providers</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Notifying the insurance companies that your loved one held policies with is one of the first tasks to complete in the administrative process. Most providers have a designated bereavement support customer service team who should explain the next steps to you once you’ve made the initial contact.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Who can do this?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In most cases, the insurance companies will need to speak to the executor of a will or the next-of-kin/administrator if your loved one died without leaving a will.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>When to do this?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ideally, you should notify insurers within a month of your loved one’s death once you have a death certificate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Claiming life insurance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Step 1 - How to find out if your loved one had a life insurance policy</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Firstly, check their will (if they had one), their bank statements, or ask their solicitor (if they had one). You can also visit the Unclaimed Asset Register, which is a database of thousands of life insurance policies, unclaimed pensions, shares, dividends, dormant savings accounts and lottery winnings. It costs £25 to run a search for a life policy. Access it here: <a href="https://www.uar.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uar.co.uk</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Step 2 - Contacting the insurer</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Contact the insurance provider to make them aware of your situation and to let them know you are going to make a claim. You will need:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Your loved one’s name, last address and date of birth</li>
<li>The policy number (found on the policy documents or a bank statement)</li>
<li>The cause and place of death</li>
<li>Medical reports from a doctor if you are claiming for a terminal illness</li>
<li>An original death certificate</li>
<li>Your contact details and relationship with the person who died</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you cannot find all this information, call them with what you do have.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Step 3 - After the initial contact</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the first contact about the claim, an assessor will let you know of any extra information or documents they need from you. They will probably ask for a copy of the death certificate, information from the doctor of the deceased, and/or legal documentation, depending on the type of policy and circumstances of the death.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Notifying their home insurance provider</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Contact your loved one’s home insurance provider with the following information:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Your loved one’s name, last address and date of birth</li>
<li>A certified copy of their death certificate (if you have one at this stage)</li>
<li>The policy number</li>
<li>Your own proof of identity, for example, a valid driving license or passport</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The insurer should then guide you through the next steps and advise you of any further details or documentation needed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Notifying their car insurance provider</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Contact your loved one’s car insurance provider with the following information:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Your loved one’s name, last address and date of birth</li>
<li>A certified copy of their death certificate (if you have one at this stage)</li>
<li>The policy number</li>
<li>The vehicle registration number</li>
<li>Your own proof of identity, for example, a valid driving license or passport</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re a named driver on the car insurance policy, check with the insurers whether you’re still covered. If you are not, you will need to get a new policy in place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Watch out - most policies terminate on the death of the main policy holder and this will leave the car uninsured. Ideally, the car should be parked in private parking instead of on the road.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The provider should then guide you through the next steps and advise you of any further details or documentation needed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Our advice for contacting insurers</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have your own personal details to hand if you are contacting the insurance provider over the phone</li>
<li>It might be worth thinking ahead of time about what you would like to do with the policy - for example, whether you want to cancel it or change it into a different name. There may be extra costs for this</li>
<li>Have a pen and paper to hand to make notes of the call and any important timeframes. Don’t be afraid to ask the company to confirm any changes or closing of accounts in writing</li>
</ul>

		How to notify banks of a bereavement

		<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center","style":{"color":{"background":"#fbe0c3","text":"#003946"}}} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#fbe0c3;color:#003946">To meet others who share a similar experience of loss, as well as step-by-step guides to navigating the practical admin that comes after a loss, <a href="https://onelink.to/zka2sa">join the Untangle app</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the first administrative tasks is to notify the banks and building societies where your loved one held accounts. Most banks and building societies have a designated bereavement support customer service team, and they should explain the next steps to you once you’ve made the initial contact. The Death Notification Service covers most of the common banks and building societies in the UK - this is a useful tool to avoid having to contact multiple organisations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Who can do this?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In most cases, the banks and building societies will need to speak to the executor of a will, or the next-of-kin/administrator if your loved one died without leaving a will.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>When to do this?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is one of the first tasks you'll need to complete. Once you have a death certificate, contact the bank or building society so they can temporarily freeze any payment in or out of the account. Joint bank accounts can continue to be used as normal. Any funds in the account can be used to pay for the funeral and probate fees or Inheritance Tax, if applicable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Introduction to the Death Notification Service</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We recommend using the Death Notification Service to start the process of notifying financial organisations. This service allows you to inform several banks and building societies of your loved one’s death at the same time. You just have to fill out one form and it will notify all the providers for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>Using the Death Notification Service (DNS)</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->


<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Step 1 - Gather the following details about your loved one:</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->


<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Their full name </li>
<li>Their date of birth</li>
<li>The date of their death</li>
<li>Their last address</li>
<li>The Death Certificate number (also called a ‘System Number’ which can be found at the bottom left hand side of the death certificate)</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->


<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Helpful, but not mandatory, details include: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->


<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Bank account number(s) and sort code(s)</li>
<li>Building Society account number(s)</li>
<li>Confirmation of any credit cards </li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
</div>
<!-- /wp:column -->
</div>
<!-- /wp:columns -->

<!-- /wp:heading -->


<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Head to the DNS Website: <a href="https://www.deathnotificationservice.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Notification Service</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->


<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the yellow button that says ‘Submit Death Notification’ to begin. We recommend you create an account afterwards so you can add other accounts that you might have forgotten about at a later date.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->


<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Step 3 - Next steps</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->


<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Within 10 working days, you should receive instructions of what to do next from each of the individual financial organisations. For example, you may need to provide a copy of the death certificate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->


<!-- wp:heading -->

		<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Managing wills and probate can be complicated, so here is a guide to the steps you will need to take - whether you are working with a solicitor or doing it yourself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>If your loved one had a will: You'll need to apply for a grant of probate</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>The probate process: how long does probate take, and who can do it?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Obtaining a grant of probate allows you to access your loved one’s assets and distribute them in accordance with their will. The executor of the will should apply for probate within a few months of your loved one’s death, as it may be necessary to access and close certain accounts that your loved one held. The probate process can vary in length, but on average, administration takes 6-9 months.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>You don’t need it if:</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>The person had no assets outside the UK, and</li>
<li>All assets were jointly owned (eg. Mr &amp; Mrs Jones’s bank account), <strong>or</strong></li>
<li>The value of the estate is less than £10,000 - but make sure you check with the financial providers!</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>You are likely to need probate if any of these apply to you:</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>If your loved one had any assets overseas - this includes property or financial accounts</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>If your loved one had financial assets valued at over £10,000 that were not jointly owned e.g stocks, shares, savings</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>If the value of your loved one’s estate (everything they owned) is more than £10,000 - this includes property, money and possessions. Each bank has its own threshold to determine whether you need probate to access your loved one’s account with them</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To find out the thresholds for probate, contact the account provider(s). If you do need to apply for grant of probate, follow the steps in our guide below:</p>

<h2>If your loved one didn't have a will: You'll need to apply for a letter of administration</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>What is letter of administration and who can do it?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Obtaining a letter of administration allows you to access your loved one’s assets and distribute them in accordance with their will. The executor of the will should apply for probate within a few months of your loved one’s death, as it may be necessary to access and close certain accounts that your loved one held.<br />In this situation, the person who deals with the estate is usually the deceased’s next-of-kin, such as a spouse or child. You should apply for a letter of administration within the first few months of your loved one’s death if you need to access or handle their accounts.</p>

<h3>What is an estate?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An estate is everything your loved one owned. This includes property, money in their financial accounts (eg. bank, building society, pension pot) and possessions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>First, you need to value the money and all financial assets they owned</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You might have already contacted all the financial organisations your loved one held accounts with. Just as a reminder, organisations to contact often include:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Their bank or building society - ask them to freeze any payments into or out of the account until you have applied for probate</li>
<li><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/finding-lost-pensions/">Their pension provider</a></li>
<li>Any companies with which they held stocks or shares</li>
<li>Their employer - they may be owed wages</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ask each of the organisations for a statement of the value of the assets and any debts held by the deceased. If they had a mortgage, ask their mortgage lender if they require payments to continue while you are completing the probate process.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make a list of all the information you receive from the financial account providers. Include any lump sums from pensions or life insurance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Then, you will need to consider any gifts made by the person who has died, which took place within the 7 years prior to their death.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Any gifts which totalled less than £3,000 in any year are exempt, as are any gifts made to charity or to a spouse or civil partner.  There are some other exemptions which apply to smaller gifts for weddings or special occasions, and where the gifts have been made out of surplus income.  If you have any doubt, you should seek professional advice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Next, value your loved one’s possessions</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Make a list of all the possessions they owned and whether these were privately or jointly owned. The list might include property, furniture, artwork, jewellery and cars</li>
<li>Estimate the value of each of these possessions on the day that your loved one died. This is a rough price that each item could realistically be sold for, not the price they paid. You can research this online, or get a professional valuation. If the estate is liable to inheritance tax (see below), you are likely to need a professional valuation</li>
<li>Divide any assets jointly owned with your loved one’s spouse or civil partner by two. For any assets owned by more than two people, divide the asset by the number of owners</li>
<li>To value a property for probate or letter of administration:
<ul>
<li>a) If you know the value is not close to the Inheritance Tax threshold of £325,000, you can carry out a property valuation for probate yourself by searching for it on Zoopla, or searching for the value of similar properties in the same area</li>
<li>b) You can use a local estate agent, but if you think the property may be valued near to the Inheritance Tax threshold (£325,000), it is recommended that you use a chartered surveyor as they will have more experience valuing a property for probate and Inheritance Tax purposes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Add these figures together for an estimation of the total value of the estate for probate or letter of administration.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Feeling a bit stuck?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We understand that calculating the value of an estate for probate is complicated. Although this guide will help you, others have said that using a solicitor takes away the pressure of dealing with estate laws and wills. Take a look at our trusted solicitor partners.</p>

<h2>What is Inheritance Tax?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Inheritance Tax is a tax you have to pay upon inheriting the estate of someone who has died, including all of their property, possessions and money. It needs to be paid by the executor. Inheritance Tax must be paid or partially paid before probate or letter of administration can be granted, although there are some exceptions. Inheritance tax is sometimes referred to as Capital Gains tax.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What is the threshold for paying Inheritance Tax?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You will need to pay Inheritance Tax if the estate is valued at over £325,000. Usually, anything over this threshold is taxed at a rate of 40%. However, there are many exceptions to this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For more information: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/inheritance-tax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gov.uk</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many other possible assets that might need to be added to the value of the estate to comply with estate law. These include interests in trusts (which might have arisen on the earlier death of a spouse), transfers of value within the last 7 years, or gifts made at any time where the person who has died retained some kind of benefit in the asset given away,  An example of this might be putting a house in the name of children, but continuing to live there or visit on holiday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Typically, no Inheritance Tax is due if:</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/calculating-the-value-of-the-estate-probate/">The value of the estate</a> (taking into account all of the issues above) is below £325,000 - this is known as the Nil Rate Band (NRB)</li>
<li>Everything above the threshold is left to a spouse or civil partner, <strong>or</strong></li>
<li>Everything above the threshold is left to an exempt beneficiary such as a charity</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You are obliged to file a report with HMRC even if there is no tax to pay. You can do this here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/inheritance-tax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gov.uk</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>If you don’t need to pay Inheritance Tax, skip to Step 3: Applying for Probate or Letter of Administration</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Where do you get the money to pay?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Banks or building societies may release money out of your loved one’s account before probate or letter of administration has been issued if it is being used to pay Inheritance Tax directly to HMRC. If you are paying Inheritance Tax on property, HMRC may accept staggered payments spread over a period of time. If you pay the Inheritance Tax out of your own money, you can get a refund from the estate once probate has been granted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How to pay:</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol>
<li>Value your loved one’s estate (Step 1)</li>
<li>Decide whether it is likely that you will need to pay any Inheritance Tax based on the information in Step 2</li>
<li>Report the estimated value of the estate to HMRC (even if you will not need to pay Inheritance Tax)
<ul>
<li>You can do this here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died/tell-hmrc-estate-value" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gov.uk</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you think you need to pay Inheritance Tax, apply for a reference number. This needs to happen at least three weeks before you make a payment.
<ul>
<li>You can do this here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/paying-inheritance-tax/get-a-reference-number" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gov.uk</a></li>

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The original will (if you have one)</li><li>The original death certificate or an interim death certificate from the coroner</li><li>A completed estimation and report of <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/calculating-the-value-of-the-estate-probate/">the value of the estate</a> from HMRC, as completed in Step 1</li><li>Depending on the value of the estate, a notice from HMRC saying that you’ve either paid Inheritance Tax or have no tax to pay, as completed in Step 2 or 3 (this can be corrected if necessary after <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/wills-and-probate/">the probate/ letter of administration</a> application is complete).</li></ul>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Things to note:</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The application fee is £273 if the value of the estate is £5,000 or over. There is no application fee if the estate is under £5,000. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Extra copies of the grant of probate or letter of administration cost £1.50 each. It is worth getting a few copies - we would recommend one for each account you still have to close, so you are able to send them to different organisations at the same time.

<li>Depending upon the financial situation of your loved one, you can now pay off any debts from the estate and distribute their assets according to their will (if there is one)</li>

		Understanding grief and trauma

		<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After experiencing bereavement, grief can feel so overwhelming that it can be hard to know whether your feelings are normal or whether you may be suffering from trauma. Understanding the difference between <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/symptoms-of-grief/" data-type="post" data-id="4410">grief symptoms</a> and trauma can help you recognise a trauma response and know when and how to seek help.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>The distinction between grief symptoms and trauma</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grief is a painful and complex set of emotions and can involve feelings of numbness, sadness, anger, and distress. It is a natural, human response to loss. There is no set grieving process, but over time, your feelings around your loss ebb and flow, and you find healthy ways to remember your loved one as you settle into a ‘new normal’.<br>Trauma is an emotional response to a distressing or disturbing event. Sometimes, bereavement can result in trauma, for example, if the death was unexpected, a result of violent crime, or was out of the expected natural order, such as the death of a child or young person. In these cases, you not only have the loss to process, but also the circumstances around the death. A prolonged trauma response is known as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A trauma response is your body’s attempt at protecting you from perceived danger. It puts you into a state of hyperarousal, or ‘shock’, linked to the fight/flight/freeze responses. PTSD can present as agitation and aggression (fight), anxiety and hyperactivity (flight), and feelings of disconnection or numbness (freeze). Trauma can also produce physical effects, such as headaches, nausea, digestive problems, sleep disturbances, changes in breathing or swallowing, and panic attacks.<br><br>As your brain continues to revisit the trauma, you might experience flashbacks and vivid dreams or nightmares. The impact of these distressing symptoms can be emotionally, psychologically and physically exhausting, and if left untreated, can cause long-lasting impacts on your health, relationships and daily life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>When should I seek help?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s normal to feel a range of emotions as you grieve. As long as you can continue to move forward by working through your thoughts and feelings about your loss and leaning on friends and family if you need to, therapy isn’t usually necessary.<br>However, if you have any of the psychological or physical signs mentioned above or dealing with grief is stopping you from living your day to day life, you may be experiencing trauma and should seek advice from a professional. Using alcohol or drugs to help you manage your grief can be another sign that you may need to ask for help. Sometimes, people might not spot the signs of trauma in themselves, but the people around them start to pick up on changes in their personality or behaviour and suggest that they seek help.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you suspect you have trauma, a trained therapist or counsellor can carry out an assessment involving a series of questions designed to identify signs of trauma. They can then work with you to help you manage the symptoms and start to heal. <strong><a href="https://join.untanglegrief.com/therapy/?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=seo&amp;utm_campaign=grief-and-trauma">Find your perfect therapist or counsellor with Untangle.</a></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Who can help me?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are various ways of addressing and treating trauma and PTSD. When considering the available options, look for a service that delivers trauma-informed care, using specific techniques that avoid the risk of causing further trauma.<br>Trauma therapy or bereavement counselling can provide specialist treatment for PTSD. Two treatment modalities have been shown to be particularly effective in treating trauma: EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing) and trauma-focused CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy).&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Medication is not generally used as a first-line treatment option for PTSD but can sometimes be used alongside talking therapies. Your GP can advise you further.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grief groups can provide additional support while you work through trauma and grief. We arrange various <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/events/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><u>online support groups</u></strong></a> that can help connect you with other people going through similar experiences.</p>

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Linn- "I personally liked not being pushed; it was great to know I could come back anytime if I changed my mind. You don’t want to think about things when you’re in that headspace; you want very few options - you want to do the very minimum to get where you want to be, and because of the simple form, I didn’t feel overwhelmed. The therapist I am matched with is great. I never felt like I had to stick with someone I didn’t like."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Lexie- "I found the whole process so simple - within a week or so, I’d had an initial session with a counsellor, and I’m still having sessions now. It was one of those things that you don’t realise you need until you’ve had it. It was a nice, easy process that made dealing with it at a time of high emotion easier. Without Untangle, I wouldn’t have known who to contact. I didn’t know that grief counselling was a thing."</p>

		Is therapy right for me?

		<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are considering counselling or therapy to deal with grief and bereavement, here are some pointers from two experts to help you think it through. Like unwelcome visitors, loss, bereavement and grief will inevitably turn up and insist on becoming part of our lives at some point. When they do, there’s no right or wrong way to feel or act - we are all different. But if life feels like too much to cope with, talking to a professional can really help. “A lot of people find it difficult to express themselves with family or friends,” says Adetoun Adams, an NHS psychotherapist and a counsellor for the charity Mind in East London. “Talking to a stranger allows people to open up and can make things feel lighter.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Talking therapies</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Grief counselling is often the go-to approach rather than therapy,” says Dr Iain Jordan, a consultant in psychological medicine at Oxford University Hospitals. “Just talking through your problems and experiences in counselling, especially very painful ones, is very valuable.” However, some types of loss are more complex and traumatic than others, and there are many other types of ‘talking therapies’ that you can explore or request to be referred for, including clinical behavioural therapy (CBT), mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, and dynamic or interpersonal psychotherapy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Exploring your new identity in therapy after a loss can be vital, for example – such as figuring out who you are once you are no longer someone’s wife, daughter, or sister. Iain recommends therapy after a traumatic event as “you can recover by telling a different story, learning strategies for behaving differently, or changing unhelpful beliefs and assumptions.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Choosing a therapist</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’ve decided to try therapy, Iain recommends doing a little research and having a brief phone call with a few different therapists to see if there’s chemistry: “A mutually trusting relationship is fundamental – without it nothing will happen.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It is OK to ask for someone who matches your life experience,” says Adetoun. “A black person might feel more comfortable seeing a black therapist, for example. Or you can ask to see a woman because you have issues with men.” However, Iain suggests thinking through the reasons behind your preference. “Are you avoiding something that you should be experiencing? Or is it because only this person can understand my experiences? “For example, if I am a man with a toxic attitude towards women, it might be a good idea for me to see a female therapist to focus on that.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Accessing therapy</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the UK, your GP can refer you for free NHS support, or you can self-refer through the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme which will assess you before assigning you to a therapist. You can also go through your local Mind branch. In some areas there is often a long NHS waiting list, but it depends on the severity of your needs as to how long it will take to get seen by someone. For a recent loss, you can get three sessions of early bereavement support and then go back on the list to a wait for a therapist in the longer term.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want to go private and pay, Adetoun and Iain recommend looking for a therapist or counsellor on trusted websites including <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/psychologytoday.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>psychologytoday.com</u></a> and the British Association of Counsellors, or <strong><a href="https://join.untanglegrief.com/therapy/?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=seo&amp;utm_campaign=is-therapy-right-for-me">Untangle's counselling and therapy services</a>.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Virtual support</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Counselling and therapy are increasingly available online and becoming more popular in this time of social distancing. But does online grief counselling work? “The evidence so far suggests that online works as well as face-to-face therapy,” says Iain. However he feels that deeper and more intense types of therapy might be more difficult online. “Some things happen in a room that would be harder to create at a distance, and it feels like a richer encounter when you are together.” Adetoun thinks that taking part in therapy online or over the phone is better than going without, as “at least you are talking to someone.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Medication - or exercise?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some of us might consider drugs to tackle issues like depression, but Iain isn’t a big fan of prescribing medication for people who are grieving, sad or anxious. “There should be a clear indication for it,” he explains. “Even if you have clinical-level disorder the effect is only slightly better than with a placebo”. Instead, he suggests putting an emphasis on exercise and eating well, keeping up connections with your loved ones, and making time to enjoy small day-to-day activities are probably more effective when combined together. “But if you are suffering terribly, talk to your doctor about medication to help you through a difficult period,” he continues. “You can then go on to get better in other ways, including therapy.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>So does grief counselling work?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Telling a complete stranger your innermost thoughts can feel scary, but Adetoun’s advice is to try it before making your mind up: “Therapists have to provide a safe environment,” she explains. “You will be listened to, not judged, and everything is confidential.” Iain agrees: “Be curious. If you are suffering, want to behave differently or understand yourself better, any kind of therapy is useful. And you should grieve. You are supposed to stop and reflect. You’ll miss out if you don’t. It allows for a new period of transition.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“There’s an old joke that goes ‘how many therapists does it take to change a lightbulb’? The answer is: ‘Only one - if the lightbulb wants to change’. If you are willing to open yourself up to a different way of seeing yourself, it is almost always the right thing.” Often you won’t need long-term therapy: “after a bereavement some people just need one or two good sessions,” says Adetoun.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And your courage to take the plunge will pay off: “If people are brave enough to try, it can help them work through the different phases of their grief, or just come out feeling lighter,” she continues. “And they’ll know that although they are no longer thinking about the person they’ve lost every minute of the day, they still carry that person around in their heart.”</p>

		<h3>Things to remember about discovering secrets</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Secrets are a normal part of every person’s life. Nobody shares every aspect of themselves even with those closest to them.</li>
 	<li>It’s OK to feel overwhelmed or angry at a new revelation, but those are just feelings. They don't mean you didn't know the person.</li>
 	<li>This is just a new thing you now know about your loved one. It makes them more, not less.
Once you face your feelings, you will likely realize this wasn't really a surprise. It was always consistent with the person you knew.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">It doesn’t mean you didn’t know them; it just means they weren’t what you thought – they were more than you thought.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Things to remember about discovering secrets</h3>
Once someone you loved is gone, you might think there’s nothing left to learn about them. After all, you cannot create any new memories together. But sometimes you discover new information that casts everything you thought you knew about them into a whole new light.

If you are one of the family or friends responsible for sorting through the contents of a home, a storage locker, or a safe-deposit box, you might expect to find familiar trinkets or long-hidden treasures. But there is always a chance you will find documents or mementos you never even suspected existed.

Closing out the material aspects of a loved one’s life can often be overwhelming or even painful. When you remove their belongings from their physical space, it can seem like losing them all over again, and heightened emotions can leave you crushed by memories that flood back all at once. If in the midst of all that you also discover secrets you weren’t meant to see or facts that your loved one neglected to mention, it can feel too huge to manage. Even if they’re happy secrets, the revelation can be very unsettling.

		20 things you can do to honour your loved one: Death Anniversary Ideas 2022
		https://untanglegrief.com/?p=1718

		<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the dawn of time humans have used landmarks to navigate their environment (and they’re not the only animal to do so). Even time itself has been landmarked to help us to overlay meaning onto its infinite passing. From birthdays to <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/surviving-christmas-whilst-grieving/">Christmas</a>, from New Year's day to an anniversary, we come back year after year to these meaningful moments. And though we often think of anniversaries as opportunities for celebration, some anniversaries can be quite challenging. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One such challenging anniversary is the anniversary of a loved one passing away: The Death Anniversary; Deathday. It’s not often a topic at the dinner table, nor is it something explored in the zeitgeist. Instead, as with most things related to grief, it is often brushed under the carpet. We reckon it’s about time that we pull back that carpet and explore ways in which you can more easily navigate the challenges of The Death Anniversary and find some opportunities to celebrate and honor your loved one, that's why we've listed below our favourite 20 death anniversary ideas.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before we get into the ways in which you can make a Death Anniversary special, it’s important to first acknowledge that some people believe the best thing to do on the anniversary of a loved one’s passing is to forget, distract, and suppress. Ignoring the things that make us feel bad can seem logical. If you stick your head under the sand for long enough, maybe one’s troubles will dissolve into sweet nothingness. Of course, it never quite works out that way. Suppression has long been known to extend the lifespan of unwanted feelings. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Like a wound left untreated leads to gangrene. It’s why women heal from breakups much sooner than men (on average): they confront the tough feelings head-on; they sit in the discomfort; they ask for support from their friends and family; they cry. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas men tend to distract from PRG (Post Relationship Grief) with casual flings; drink; constant socialising; extended work hours; etc. So, as hard as it may be, if you can, try not to avoid your feelings or distract yourself from what you know is an important day (you wouldn’t be reading this if you didn’t think so).&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below we’ve compiled a list of the most popular ways people choose to remember their loved one’s deathday. Go with what resonates with you most, and feel free to get creative and venture off the list. These are just meant as a starting point. The more the experience honors the unique relationship you had with them, the more cathartic and memorable it will be. Remember though, that the experience is for you and so can be as simple and unassuming or as complex and extravagant as you want it to be.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>20 things you can do on a death anniversary:</b>

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take the day off and just give yourself the time and space to grieve.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Write a letter to your loved one. You can explore a range of things: things you miss; things you resent; traumas; things you’re grateful for; things that were left unsaid; regrets; funny things you wish they’d been there to see; things they’d be proud of; gossip; questions; things you’ve let go of or forgiven; things that still make you laugh.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scatter some of their ashes somewhere meaningful. On a favourite walk or at the top of a mountain you used to climb together.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do something you liked to do together – bring a friend or family member if you need support.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Travel to somewhere that’s been on your bucket list for a while.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plant something in their memory. It can be extremely comforting to watch it grow over time.&nbsp;</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throw a dinner party with people that knew your loved one well. Share stories. Laugh. Cry. Console. Connect.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make it a potluck with your family, with everyone bringing your loved one’s favourite foods.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go for a long walk. Take a friend or two and talk out your feelings, or walk alone and have some quiet time to think.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at their photos, videos, letters, journals, clothes, jewellery, books, and anything else they left behind. Maybe add some of these things to a scrap book.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a duvet day and watch their favourite films or TV shows.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a class to learn to do something your loved one enjoyed - this can be particularly connecting and help you to continue to get to know them.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go somewhere that was special to the two of you. Leave them flowers and a note.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spend the day helping others: do a charity run, or organise a fundraiser for a cause that mattered to the person you’ve lost.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are religious, go to a service, spend the day with your community or take part in a memorial ritual.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a big gathering and set off some fireworks in their memory.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Go see one of their favourite bands play live.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make a mix tape or Spotify playlist of tracks that they loved and listen to them.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Do something you used to do together: snowboarding, hiking, ultra distance running, traveling, dancing, singing etc.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Paint, draw, write a poem, or play a song to celebrate your loved one.</span></li>

		The 200 Best Funeral Songs of All Time - 2022 Edition

		<h1><b>The 200 Best Funeral Songs of All Time</b></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Music has been with us for about 35,000 years. To put that into perspective, we’ve farmed for just 12,000 years. So we were singing and making beats with sticks long before we ever considered planting wheat seeds. </span>

All this to say, music is deep in our bones. And it has a way of transcending all other things; of perfectly encapsulating a feeling or an emotion and bringing people together.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not uncommon for us to use songs like bookmarks for the landmarks of life. We hear a song at a wedding or a funeral and then the next time we hear it, it transports us back. We are there again, remembering it like it were yesterday.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why music is such an important consideration for a funeral. Pick funeral songs that capture the feeling of the moment and you’ll immortalise your loved one. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the gravity of your funeral song choices, it’s easy to get stuck deciding between a thousand different songs. We recommend in these instances that you try choosing songs that most closely match the song preferences of your loved one rather than random songs you hear on the radio.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Below we have the 200 best funeral songs for mum, funeral songs for dad, and the best funeral songs for grandparents. We’ve included a wide range of songs from old-school classics to modern hits, from the Top of the Pops to the gems off the beaten track - so there’s something for everyone. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tip: If you’re looking to book a funeral service or want a funeral planner, reach out to us and we’ll be happy to provide free advice. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>Best Funeral Songs - Our Top 200 Favourites</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When </span><a href="https://www.dignityfunerals.co.uk/arranging-a-funeral/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arranging a funeral</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you have full control over what music you’d like to play. You may prefer uplifting and happy funeral songs, or maybe some classical funeral music.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As funerals become more tailored to reflect the life of the person who has sadly passed away, families are opting for modern songs to be played at the service.</span>

		What to say to people grieving across different cultures
		https://untanglegrief.com/?p=2919
		Tue, 08 Feb 2022 16:20:34 +0000

		<span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be hard to know </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">what to say when someone dies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, especially if you have a different faith or cultural heritage to the bereaved person. This quick guide can help you to send the right </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">message to someone who has lost a loved one</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from Islam and Christianity to atheists and agnostics, across the continents.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Death and grief are universal experiences, but our cultural and religious traditions for showing empathy with people who have lost a loved one can vary widely.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Supporting a grieving friend or relative can bring you closer together, as long as you respect their boundaries and beliefs. Keep an open mind and remember that we all process grief differently.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A good starting point is to find out if the person grieving is religious or not. If you are afraid to ask, </span><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/03/this-is-the-best-and-simplest-world-map-of-religions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this map</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showing the size and spread of the world’s biggest faiths might give you some clues.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By doing some research you’ll have a good chance of getting it right and showing that you care.</span>
<h2><b>Christianity</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the world’s largest religion, Christian traditions surrounding death and grieving are interwoven with local ones. A </span><a href="https://www.cypresslawn.com/blog/mexican-funeral-traditions/#:~:text=In%20Mexico%2C%20after%20a%20death,their%20clothing%20and%20important%20possessions."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mexican Catholic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may invite you to offer gifts and prayers at a 48-hour vigil, while an </span><a href="https://www.frazerconsultants.com/2017/08/cultural-spotlight-ethiopian-funeral-traditions/#:~:text=Expression%20of%20Grief&amp;text=And%20crying%20shows%20that%20the,harmful%20acts%20to%20express%20grief."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orthodox Ethiopian</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> might expect to be cared for by their community ahead of a final celebration on their 40th day of mourning. As all Christians base their faith on the Bible, offering a </span><a href="https://www.kathleenfucciministries.org/blog/50-bible-verses-for-a-grieving-heart"><span style="font-weight: 400;">verse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or prayer for their loved one, or a </span><a href="https://futureofworking.com/what-to-write-in-a-sympathy-card-religious/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">simple message</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of kindness and support in a card, could be a real source of comfort.&nbsp;</span>
<h2><b>Islam</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Muslims see death as a transition to the afterlife, and funerals take place as quickly as possible after someone passes away. Traditions vary between countries and groups, however mourners usually </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">avoid colourful clothes and jewellery</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, express their feelings quietly during the funeral or prayer service, and always take their shoes off beforehand. You can </span><a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-give-condolences-in-Arabic"><span style="font-weight: 400;">offer your condolences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the family afterwards. The mourning period can last up to 40 days, during which bereaved families often appreciate flowers, cards, words from the </span><a href="https://www.islamicity.org/5278/the-islamic-way-of-expressing-condolence-and-sympathy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qur’an</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, charity donations and gifts of (halal) food.</span>
<h2><b>Atheists and agnostics</b></h2>
<a href="https://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-exec/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around 16 per cent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the world’s population are unaffiliated with any religion, including </span><a href="https://humanism.org.uk/humanism/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">humanists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/26/atheist-grieving"><span style="font-weight: 400;">atheists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRmX9RVeNkU"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agnostics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, now forming the second biggest belief system in Europe and </span><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2016/04/160422-atheism-agnostic-secular-nones-rising-religion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North America</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Ways of grieving vary, however many choose to celebrate their loved one’s life, our connections with each other and the planet, and see death as a final destination. Try keeping things simple and heartfelt, such as sharing a favourite memory of the deceased, sending flowers or a card expressing your sympathy and support.&nbsp;</span>

<a href="http://condolencepro.com/?page_id=861"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Messages like these</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also work well if you aren’t sure how to refer to someone’s religion sensitively.&nbsp;</span>
<h2><b>Hinduism</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the world’s 1 billion+ Hindus believe that the soul reincarnates into another being after death, depending on our Karma or actions in our previous life. Funeral mourners wear white (never black) and can expect an open casket followed by a cremation. You can send the family flowers ahead of the service but avoid sending food. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hindus observe </span><a href="https://gal-dem.com/how-the-hindu-way-of-grieving-helped-overcome-losses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">13 days of mourning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, during which family, friends and community members visit to pay their respects. You can express your sympathy in </span><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-condolence-expressions-in-Hinduism"><span style="font-weight: 400;">many ways</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – including by simply offering your heartfelt condolences.</span>
<h2><b>Buddhism</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Buddhists believe that when we die we go through the process of </span><a href="https://www.learnreligions.com/samsara-449968"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">samsara</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or reincarnation, before we are reborn according to our thoughts and actions in our previous life. Fu</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">neral customs vary widely, with a common thread of peace and serenity.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can offer the family white or yellow flowers or a charity donation. Avoid anything red as it symbolises happiness. You can express your </span><a href="http://condolencecoach.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-4-immeasurables-for-condolence-to.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">condolences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a card or in person, for example, by referring to </span><a href="https://tricycle.org/magazine/four-immeasurables/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buddhism's four perfect virtues or ‘immeasurables’</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: equanimity, love, compassion and joy.&nbsp;</span>
<h2><b>Judaism</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Jewish groups have their own distinct grieving traditions, along with similarities such as burying their dead within a day whenever possible. Avoid sending flowers, wear dark clothes during the funeral, and feel free to </span><a href="https://www.shiva.com/learning-center/death-and-mourning/placing-a-stone/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">place a small stone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the grave with your left hand. Most families observe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;“</span><a href="https://www.shiva.com/learning-center/understanding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shiva</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” – the mourning period – during which visitors can send or bring (kosher) food baskets.&nbsp;&nbsp;“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">May God console you among the other mourners of Zion and Jerusalem</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” is one of many ways to </span><a href="https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/jewish-words-of-comfort/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">offer your condolences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a Jewish person.&nbsp;</span>

		The stages of grief myth
		https://untanglegrief.com/the-stages-of-grief-myth/
		Wed, 11 Aug 2021 09:37:09 +0000

		<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You are probably aware of the theory that after experiencing bereavement, we go through stages of grief. The well-known theory describes five stages, while others describe six, or seven stages. But, what if this widely accepted theory is merely a myth and there is no set grieving process at all? What if everyone grieves in their own way?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here at Untangle, we believe that the long-standing stages of grief theory is misleading and unhelpful and fails to accurately represent how most people experience grief.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>The Five Stages of Grief Theory</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><p>The 5 stages of grief model was developed by psychiatrist Kübler-Ross in 1969. Although grief models had been discussed before this time, it was Kübler-Ross’s theory that gained traction and made it into the public psyche.</p>
<p>The 5 stages of grief described in the model are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.</p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><p>Over time, people came to think of the 5 stages of grief as the ‘correct’ way to grieve, believing that mourners must pass through each stage to complete the grieving process. In the years since its first publication, the theory has been debunked by many professionals. In fact, it’s reported that before her death, Kübler-Ross herself expressed regret at how her model was viewed. She said that it was never intended to suggest a linear progression through grief, but rather to explore the various reactions we might have after loss.</p>
<p>But despite her regret, the stages of grief myth persisted.</p></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>David Kessler: The Sixth Stage of Grief</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.davidkesslertraining.com/">Kessler is a death and grief expert</a> who co-wrote two books with Kübler-Ross, as well as many &nbsp;of his own books. One of his theories builds upon the 5 stages of grief to add a sixth stage: finding meaning. Kessler argues that after we pass through the grieving process, we can transform grief into peace and hope by finding meaning in our life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Seven Stages of Grief</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At various times over the years, others stages have been added to Kübler-Ross’s model, too. You might have heard of the 7 stages of grief, which adds ‘shock and disbelief’ as stage one, and ‘reconstruction’ before the final stage of ‘acceptance’. Just as with the 5-stage and 6-stage grief theories, this presents a rather linear process that we don’t think is true to life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Other Theories</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In more recent years, many counselling and bereavement experts have looked for other ways to describe our experience of grief. Most acknowledge that grief isn’t a linear process and that people experience it in different ways.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. Tonkin’s model: Growing around Grief</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lois Tonkin is a grief counsellor who coined the term ‘growing around grief’ after counselling clients who had experienced loss. She describes that rather than grief disappearing over time, it stays roughly the same, and the life of a bereaved person grows around it as they have new experiences and begin to look forward. At times, that grief can feel just as painful as it did at the beginning, and at other times, it’s in the background.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Worden’s theory: Tasks of Mourning</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>William Worden, a psychology academic and child-bereavement expert, identified four ‘tasks’ that he says are an active part of grieving. He stresses that the tasks are not completed in a linear fashion and that people often return to each of the tasks at different times of their lives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fours tasks are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>To accept the reality of the loss</li><li>To work through the pain of grief</li><li>To adjust to a world without the person who has died, and</li><li>To find an enduring connection with the person who has died, even when moving forward with life.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. Stroebe and Schut: The Dual Process Model of Coping</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stroebe and Schut’s Dual Process Model breaks down grief into loss orientation and restoration orientation. Loss involves recognising and accepting that the person has died and how that affects other areas of life such as friendships and finances. Restoration focuses on the moments we can put grief aside to rebuild a life without the person who died. People frequently move between the two as they grieve.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>The Stages of Grief Myth: Why it matters</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The stages of grief model has become so widely accepted that it influences our cultural beliefs and attitude towards supporting people who have experienced loss. These misconceptions not only impact our ability to offer good bereavement support, but also give the impression that if you’re not moving through the stages of grief then you’re not grieving properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A 2010 study found that the majority of undergraduate psychiatric nursing textbooks contain myths about the grieving process:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>87% said that there are stages or a predictable course of grief</li><li>70% said that negative emotions such as depression are inevitable</li><li>65% said that there is a specific timeline for when grieving will occur</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>None of these statements is backed with evidence, but they are presented to psychiatric nursing students as fact. The fact that the stages of grief myth is perpetuated in these environments means that even our healthcare professionals are not taught how to handle grief effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Part of our passion at Untangle comes from recognising the gaps in the current bereavement support provision. We provide <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/what-to-expect-at-a-grief-support-group/">wellbeing support</a> and <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/bereavement-guides/">practical help</a> for our community of people who are rebuilding their lives after loss. And we understand that every grief experience is as unique as the person experiencing it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It can be hard to know what to say when someone dies, especially if you have a different faith or cultural heritage to the bereaved person. This quick guide can help you to send the right message to someone who has lost a loved one, from Islam and Christianity to atheists and agnostics, across the continents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Death and grief are universal experiences, but our cultural and religious traditions for showing empathy with people who have lost a loved one can vary widely. Supporting a grieving friend or relative can bring you closer together, as long as you respect their boundaries and beliefs. Keep an open mind and remember that we all process grief differently.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A good starting point is to find out if the person grieving is religious or not. If you are afraid to ask, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/03/this-is-the-best-and-simplest-world-map-of-religions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u><strong>this map</strong></u></a> showing the size and spread of the world’s biggest faiths might give you some clues. By doing some research you’ll have a good chance of getting it right and showing that you care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Christianity</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the world’s largest religion, Christian traditions surrounding death and grieving are interwoven with local ones. A <a href="https://www.cypresslawn.com/blog/mexican-funeral-traditions/#:~:text=In%20Mexico%2C%20after%20a%20death,their%20clothing%20and%20important%20possessions." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u><strong>Mexican Catholic</strong></u></a> may invite you to offer gifts and prayers at a 48-hour vigil, while an <a href="https://web.frazerconsultants.com/2017/08/cultural-spotlight-ethiopian-funeral-traditions/#:~:text=Expression%20of%20Grief&amp;text=And%20crying%20shows%20that%20the,harmful%20acts%20to%20express%20grief." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u><strong>Orthodox Ethiopian</strong></u></a> might expect to be cared for by their community ahead of a final celebration on their 40th day of mourning. As all Christians base their faith on the Bible, offering a <a href="https://www.kathleenfucciministries.org/blog/50-bible-verses-for-a-grieving-heart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u><strong>verse</strong></u></a> or prayer for their loved one, or a <a href="https://futureofworking.com/what-to-write-in-a-sympathy-card-religious/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u><strong>simple message</strong></u></a> of kindness and support in a card, could be a real source of comfort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Islam</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Muslims see death as a transition to the afterlife, and funerals take place as quickly as possible after someone passes away. Traditions vary between countries and groups, however mourners usually avoid colourful clothes and jewellery, express their feelings quietly during the funeral or prayer service, and always take their shoes off beforehand. You can <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-give-condolences-in-Arabic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u><strong>offer your condolences</strong></u></a> to the family afterwards. The mourning period can last up to 40 days, during which bereaved families often appreciate flowers, cards, words from the <a href="https://www.islamicity.org/5278/the-islamic-way-of-expressing-condolence-and-sympathy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u><strong>Qur’an</strong></u></a>, charity donations and gifts of (halal) food.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Atheists and agnostics</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Around 16 per cent of the world’s population are unaffiliated with any religion, including humanists, atheists and agnostics, now forming the second biggest belief system in Europe and North America. Ways of grieving vary, however <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/how-to-memorial-ceremony/">many choose to celebrate their loved one’s life</a>, our connections with each other and the planet, and see death as a final destination. Try keeping things simple and heartfelt, such as sharing a favourite memory of the deceased, sending flowers or a card expressing your sympathy and support.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="http://condolencepro.com/?page_id=861" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u><strong>Messages like these</strong></u></a> also work well if you aren’t sure how to refer to someone’s religion sensitively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Hinduism</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of the world’s 1 billion+ Hindus believe that the soul reincarnates into another being after death, depending on our Karma or actions in our previous life. Funeral mourners wear white (never black) and can expect an open casket followed by a cremation. You can send the family flowers ahead of the service but avoid sending food. Hindus observe 13 days of mourning, during which family, friends and community members visit to pay their respects. You can express your sympathy in <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-condolence-expressions-in-Hinduism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u><strong>many ways</strong></u></a> – including by simply offering your heartfelt condolences.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Buddhism</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Buddhists believe that when we die we go through the process of samsara, or reincarnation, before we are reborn according to our thoughts and actions in our previous life. Funeral customs vary widely, with a common thread of peace and serenity. You can offer the family white or yellow flowers or a charity donation. Avoid anything red as it symbolises happiness. You can express your condolences in a card or in person, for example, by referring to <a href="https://tricycle.org/magazine/four-immeasurables/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u><strong>Buddhism's four perfect virtues or ‘immeasurables’</strong></u></a>: equanimity, love, compassion and joy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Judaism</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many Jewish groups have their own distinct grieving traditions, along with similarities such as burying their dead within a day whenever possible. Avoid sending flowers, wear dark clothes during the funeral, and feel free to place a small stone on the grave with your left hand. Most families observe “Shiva” – the mourning period – during which visitors can send or bring (kosher) food baskets.  “May God console you among the other mourners of Zion and Jerusalem” is one of many ways to <a href="https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/jewish-words-of-comfort/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u><strong>offer your condolences</strong></u></a> to a Jewish person.</p>

<p>Grief after bereavement doesn’t end with the funeral, and there are lots of ways to continue honouring the person who has died and find comfort in the process. <em>By Hannah Jackson-McCamley, Funeral Celebrant </em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Hannah is an <a href="https://www.hannahthecelebrant.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u><strong>experienced celebrant who specialises in unique services</strong></u></a> that truly reflect the person that has died and the needs of those left behind. She is passionate about people, music, literature and travel and is training to be a psychotherapist.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When someone you love dies, it might seem as if life returns to “normal” for those around you once the funeral is over. Relatives might check in less often, and offerings of flowers or food dry up as friends assume you’re starting to ‘get over’ your bereavement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Death, unfortunately, isn’t something we ever get over. But we can try to make peace with what has happened and even find joy when thinking of the past.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What does it mean to memorialise someone?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My experience as a celebrant has taught me that finding different ways to remember the person that has died can really help us cope with our grief. When everything feels chaotic and the world is a little emptier than before, creating rituals that hold meaning can give you a sense of control and positivity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It might be hard to look at old photos of happier times or listen to songs your lost person played when you were a kid. But a simple memorial rite can also alleviate pain and give you a sense of the person still being present in your life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A memorial may sound a little grand - I’m not talking about unveiling a statue or starting a foundation in their name (although if that’s how you want to create a legacy, go for it – see below for more ideas!).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Memorials can be simple things that you hold close or share just with family and friends. Here are some suggestions:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Memorialising someone by yourself</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Watch the sunset or light a candle for your loved one when you miss them. Sunlight and flames are symbolic of life, create a warm atmosphere, and are also very peaceful to watch.</li><li>Say your person’s name, drop them into conversation, and share memories with your children and others who might never have met them.</li><li>Create an altar or small area devoted to your lost one - it can be as simple as a photo, or a snow globe they brought back from a trip, or a letter they sent you, etc.</li><li>Make a memory box or scrapbook of mementoes - ticket stubs, photos, birthday cards, dried flowers, etc.</li><li>Go to a place you both loved, alone, with the dog or other people, have a picnic there on birthdays and anniversaries, or whenever you feel like it.</li><li>Create a playlist of their favourite music and play it when you want to feel their presence.</li><li>Reupholster a piece of their furniture, give it pride of place at home, and use it every day.</li><li>Recycle their clothes, wear their watch or a jewellery. you can always update them by adding a new strap or recycling stones to create a new piece from the past. I got my Dad’s overcoat tailored to fit and I feel him with me whenever I wear it.</li><li>Plant a tree or a flower in a meaningful place or in your garden or grow a rosemary bush on your windowsill. It’s delicious to cook with and a traditional symbol of remembrance.</li><li>Write their life story or note down your favourite memories in a memory book. Ask others to contribute and add photos. On the first anniversary of their passing, send a bound version to people they loved.</li><li>Write a letter to your person on your birthday, telling them your news.</li><li>Give blood or register as a donor – it could help save someone else’s life.</li><li>Volunteer at the hospital or home that cared for them. This may be triggering for some, but cathartic to others.</li><li>Use art to express your feelings - poetry, painting, music, writing… let it all out.</li><li>When you travel, leave a flower or note in a special place or light a candle in a faraway sacred space, like a church or synagogue.</li><li>Try things your person liked - gigs, foods, bungee jumping - experiencing things they enjoyed might make you feel closer.</li><li>Talk to them. Let them know how you’re getting on.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Memorialising with others</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Build a shared online photo album with friends and family. Ask others to contribute and update it whenever memories of your lost person come to mind.</li><li><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/how-to-memorial-ceremony/">Set an annual day of celebration</a> – small or big – to honour their life.</li><li>Host a dinner party (on Zoom or Skype if necessary) and cook a meal they used to love. Ask others to bring a dish that reminds them of the person or cook their favourite recipe together.</li><li>Host a party on their birthday or anniversary - e.g. a “Dead Dad Party” - remembrance doesn’t need to be sad!</li><li>Make a quilt or toys from their clothes to pass on to the next generation, inviting others to contribute a square or two.</li><li>List their favourite films and host screenings in their memory.</li><li>Get together and talk about your loved one - the good, the bad and the ugly, joy as well as sorrow.</li><li>Give people they loved their best loved books as gifts.</li><li>Toast them on holidays and festivals.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Memorials that involve money</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Make a charitable donation or join a charity fundraiser, like a run, in your loved one’s name.</li><li>Start an annual event with friends to raise money for a good cause in their memory.</li><li>Sponsor a seat at a theatre or a football club, a park bench or a space in an art gallery.</li><li>Create a legacy fund with a charity close to their heart or set up a fund for a cause that meant something to them.</li></ul>

<p>Cherry, 26, escaped an abusive marriage and lost her dad. Untangle’s online bereavement groups helped her to face her grief, feel less alone, and start to heal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was born in China and grew up in Australia. In 2015 I moved to the US to be with my husband. The marriage became abusive and took a long time to get out of. Then, just a few months after it ended, my father passed away on December 26th 2019. My dad was 54 and it was very sudden. We were still talking and texting the day before, and the next day he just wasn’t there anymore. He was one of the most important people in my life and I was devastated. Those two things happening so close together were very difficult to process. I only had a few months to grieve for my relationship before my dad passed away. I felt numb. Another part of my grief was changing countries. I left a lot of friendships and my community behind in the US. I’m now in the UK living with my boyfriend, and because of Covid-19 it has been difficult to build my own connections here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Acknowledging grief</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I started attending <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/events" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u><strong>Untangle’s online grief support </strong></u></a>sessions in June 2020, along with other kinds of support groups. It’s definitely helped me to not feel so alone, especially now we’re so isolated. One of the reasons I joined was to meet others who shared the same feelings. Having this space is helping me learn to understand myself and my emotions. By talking about my experiences and hearing what others have been through, I’ve been able to fully acknowledge my grief – although sometimes I still feel like I’m in a dream.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Allowing yourself to feel</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first few months after my dad died it felt like I was in shock – it was very difficult to accept. Acceptance is a key step in the healing process and it takes time. The online support groups provide a safe space allowing me to feel sad, bad and angry, and to accept that this has happened to me. A good tip I got from the group is writing in a diary or journal about how you feel. One person said that after his wife passed away he would write down things he would have wanted to tell her that day – I think that’s a lovely gesture. Setting up a shrine with photos or objects that remind you of the person you’ve lost is also a nice way to immerse yourself in your memories and allow yourself to feel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Having your voice heard</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I like that the online groups are small and compact – it’s cosier and everyone has the ability to share. We all introduce ourselves briefly, then dive into talking about our experiences when we feel like it. I really like that each one of us has our turn to share and have our own voice heard. You can share as much or as little as you want to. If you don’t want to talk you are always welcome to listen and join when you are ready. You can turn off your camera if it helps you feel less overwhelmed and more in control.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>A healthy and supportive online environment</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It can be very scary to look at grief. But when you are in a healthy and supportive environment with other people who are also grieving, it is a lot easier. You don’t feel so alone and it makes you feel more capable of opening up to yourself and identifying your emotions. A couple of months ago I didn’t know that there were grief support groups out there. Having them online is great because people can access these resources from anywhere. And when you are grieving you might prefer to deal with the healing in the comfort of your own home, rather than catching the bus or train on a rainy day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I am still grieving every day. There are days when sadness and tears find me out of the blue, and also days when I feel excited to start new adventures in my life.</p>

<p>After Sarah, 47, lost two people in her life, Untangle’s online bereavement sessions gave her a safe space to talk about her grief and gain a sense of community with other people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I found Untangle after experiencing two very different losses in a very short space of time. First I lost my dad, and then just four months later my partner died. My dad was 85 and had had a good, long life. My partner’s death was very sudden – he had a cardiac arrest out of the blue. My first reaction was to bolt out of the house where I had lived for 22 years, cutting everything off. I stripped it all away: left my home, my job, everything. I tried to settle down in Mallorca, where my partner and I had considered living, but it didn’t work out. Importantly, I didn’t access any therapy in Spain – there was very little bereavement care available. I think the UK is much stronger on mental health, with support on offer through your GP and organisations like Mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Healing during lockdown</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I came back to the UK for a few weeks in March 2020 to be close to my mum, who is in a care home. And then lockdown happened. At this point I hadn’t done any real healing - I’d just gone numb, living mostly in a survival state of fight or flight. I had a real sense of displacement, identifying with what I imagined life could feel like for a refugee – because I’d lost so much: loved ones, my home, my work, my identity. When I couldn’t go anywhere because of Covid-19 I finally had a meltdown. I had to learn about self-care and begin to forgive myself for my decisions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Together under the umbrella of grief</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A friend had heard about Untangle and sent me a link, so I just filled in a simple form online. Then I was contacted about joining a free bereavement support group and started attending Zoom sessions on Sunday mornings. It worked brilliantly for me. It was scary to potentially open up in front of strangers, but we were all there together under the umbrella of grief. And it felt safe because we had a therapist and a moderator with us. They didn’t always get involved, but when something deeper was triggered it was important to have a professional there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>A sense of community</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It felt very scary to finally face my grief once the shock had subsided. But then I just fell into the routine and decided to show up for myself and for the group. It gave me a sense of community and felt very inclusive. Little comments or suggestions that someone made could make a big difference. Meeting on a Sunday morning also reminded me of going to church in my childhood, and was a good time for quiet reflection. I did sessions every week for three months. Other people came for one week or a few weeks at a time. As time went by I recognised that I was in a really strong place, and had processed a lot of stuff. Eventually it felt like the right time for me to leave and occasionally pop back in to support others – that’s my intention now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Subtle yet life-changing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being part of the online group showed me what enormous power can come from sharing in a safe space with others who are grieving. You can rock up and you don’t have to say anything - just gain a sense of connection by sitting with others who understand the extremity of losing a loved one. It’s so important to give yourself time, even if it’s just an hour, to show up to that place that you naturally want to avoid, because you just don’t want to feel anything when you grieve. Being witnessed, and witnessing others, and feeling part of a community online is incredibly effective. It’s an act of self-care - subtle but life changing, because it allows you to take the next step.</p>

<p>At just ten years old, Anna’s world was turned upside down by the sudden death of her older brother, Benny. She shares how she coped after experiencing a close bereavement at such a young age and how losing her brother has impacted her life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Anna was ten years old, her family were out one day, and Benny stayed at home alone for a few hours. During this time, Benny had a tragic accident and was found dead by a family friend. He was just twelve years old.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anna has many happy early childhood memories of playing with Benny, who was two years older than her, and her other three brothers. She remembers, “Benny and I spent a lot of time playing together. We’d imagine we were pirates in our den in the living room or play football together in our local park. We argued too, of course, usually over silly things like who had been given the biggest portion of pudding.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like most ten-year-olds, Anna had never thought about grief before, but found her view of the world changed at that moment. “It was a complete shock. I’ll never forget <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/grief-and-trauma/">the sickening, numb confusion</a> that I felt when I first found out. It honestly felt like my whole reality had been pulled from underneath me. It was a tragic, seemingly random event that changed everything.” she remembers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Support in the early days</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the early days after Benny’s death, relatives and friends rallied around: visiting, helping with the shopping and cooking, or simply sitting with Anna and her family. Anna feels lucky that she felt so surrounded by love at that time but recognises that grief can be very isolating for many people. She also credits her friends with providing some much-needed normality and fun. “There are a few friends, in particular, whom I spent a lot of time with, not necessarily talking about the loss, but doing ‘normal’ fun things that offered some light relief and reminded me that things could be good again”.</p>

<h2>Learning to be kind to herself</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the year after Benny died, Anna and her family visited a family therapist who helped them open up and communicate with each other. However, it was when Anna saw a counsellor almost ten years later that she feels she started to process Benny’s death. She says, “This support was invaluable and really helped me understand how the death has impacted my life, and how to move forward in a healthier, happier way. Things have been better since I learnt to let myself feel, rather than blocking out difficult thoughts and feelings. I’ve become much kinder to myself.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anna has also found that writing can be therapeutic, whether scribbling incoherent sentences in a journal, writing poems and stories, or writing letters to the dead. “It often makes me cry, but in a good way. It really helps un-jumble my thoughts and let go of painful emotions. It can make me feel more connected to my brother, too, like he is still alive in some way.” she explains.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>The impact of the parent-child relationship</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sibling loss can often affect the relationship between the surviving child and their parents. At such a young age, Anna had only ever seen her parents as a source of safety and love. She found it painful to realise how much they were hurting and scary that this was a situation that even they couldn’t fix. Her parents were able to continue showing love to Anna and her other brothers, despite their grief, but she remembers feeling that there was no space for her to be a child any more, with a normal child’s wants and needs. From her 10-year old’s perspective, Anna didn’t want to be a burden when her parents were already dealing with so much, and she felt a responsibility to grow up quickly to make things easier for them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anna remembers feeling like she had to be a ‘good’ child, which has had repercussions throughout her life. “I pushed my struggles to one side, which in the long run has been exhausting and lonely.” she reflects. “It’s no ones’ fault; we were just doing what we could to get through. Despite these challenges, I’m grateful that our relationship has always been grounded in love and that we found a new sort of closeness as we fumbled our way through our loss - a closeness that becomes more and more precious as time goes on.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Coping with grief over time</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s normal for grief to change as time passes, and we find new ways of coping with feelings and remembering our lost loved ones. Anna feels a sense of peace and acceptance about the loss of her brother but admits that she still does have bad days, where she goes right back to that raw grief, missing her brother and mourning the loss of a care-free life. She has found ways to manage these waves of grief and says, “I always come out the other side. I wish my brother hadn’t have died, but it taught me a lot about who I am, and has shown me how precious life is.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anna credits her friends, family and professionals for supporting her through her grief journey. She recognises that having an outlet to express her grief, and accepting love and support from the people around her have been crucial to her healing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s been tough, and it’s not a journey I would have ever chosen, but I’m making the most of it and re-discovering just how beautiful life can be, regardless of the challenges it throws at us.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>After their son Josh died suddenly, psychotherapist Jane Harris and filmmaker Jimmy Edmonds discovered creative ways to rebuild their lives and support other bereaved families.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The agony of untimely or parental grief is beyond words,” says Jane Harris. In 2011, her 22-year-old son Josh had a road accident during a trip to Vietnam and never came home. “When Josh died, I discovered that nothing much helped”. Jane and her husband, Jimmy, also found that grief can be a very lonely journey. “I realised bereaved people represent other people’s worst nightmares,” she says. As a psychotherapist Jane knew nothing could take the pain away: “You have to get alongside the grief and tolerate the discomfort.” But years of training to support others is very different from experiencing the death of your own child.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Love that never dies</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To escape the silence and isolation at home, Jane and Jimmy – a BAFTA award-winning film editor – decided to take a road trip. They wanted to meet other bereaved families and learn from their hard-won wisdom. Having met in film school, they decided to make a film in their son’s memory. The result was A Love that Never Dies, a moving insight into grief across Vietnam, India and the USA.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The experience would also teach them something new: That articulating their grief actively and creatively was the key to making it more bearable. More films followed, Jimmy wrote a book called Released and in 2015, The Good Grief Project was born, founded on their family’s experiences of losing Josh. Today, their small charity encourages people grieving the untimely death of a loved one to express their pain through photography and film, talks and retreats – even boxing workshops.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Breaking the silence, creating new bonds</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Approximately 6,000 young people aged under 24 die in the UK every year, leaving up to 50,000 bereaved relatives who often don’t know where to turn. “We live in a culture of silence when it comes to talking comfortably about death” says Jane. “But silence is deadly. Grief will find its way out either psychologically or physically. If we don’t acknowledge it, it can be catastrophic.” She says countless people have described watching their films as a turning point, because they realised there was hope out there. As well as supporting people to open up about bereavement, The Good Grief Project provides ways to create continuing bonds with the person they’ve lost. For example, using photos of their child to create a montage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Taking the mask off</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>By the end of a weekend retreat, Jane often notices a difference in participants’ body language. “They’re amazed at what they can create and start to show other people instead of wanting to keep it private,” she says. “Through photography or just being with other people they’ve been able to take the mask off and be themselves”. At a time when we’re wearing masks physically as well as metaphorically, she feels it is more important than ever to give our grief a voice. A new film, Beyond the Mask, tackling loss and isolation during Covid-19, will screen online early in the new year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Life after death</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Good Grief Project has always been a family venture. During their retreats, Josh’s sister Rosa does the cooking, while his older brother Joe, a personal trainer, runs boxing and fitness workshops, having learned to handle his own depression by being physically active. They welcome siblings as well as parents. “Bereaved siblings appreciate having a voice,” explains Jane. “They lose their parents in a way because they are so grief-stricken and watching out for them is a double whammy.” Almost 10 years after losing Josh, she feels the experience has changed her for the better. “There is definitely life after the death of a child. I would do anything to bring my son back, but he has taught me so much since he died.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“It’s a huge relief when you realise that grief can become part of your life,” she explains. “You learn to carry that person with you and fold them into your heart. We’ve created new rituals – at Christmas we raise a glass to Josh – we talk about him, and there are pictures of Uncle Josh in my grandchildren’s bedroom. “As time has passed my love for Josh doesn’t lessen. You love your child forever.”</p>

		How to hold a memorial ceremony
		https://untanglegrief.com/how-to-memorial-ceremony/

<p>Here are some ideas for organising a memorial event to celebrate the life of someone you’ve lost. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>By </em><em>Hannah Jackson-McCamley, Funeral Celebrant</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Hannah is an </em><a href="https://www.hannahthecelebrant.com/"><em>experienced celebrant who specialises in unique services</em></a><em> that truly reflect the person that has died and the needs of those left behind. She is passionate about people, music, literature and travel and is training to be a psychotherapist.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What is a memorial ceremony?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While a memorial honours the life of a person who has died, it tends to be a much more joyful and uplifting event than a funeral.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ceremony can be as simple or extravagant as you want. I’ve led very formal events, casual and relaxed ones. The tone is set by the person being remembered and the people attending. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Memorials don’t have to be expensive or involve lots of work. Always ask for help - many people like to be involved and show that they care. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are some ideas to think about (these might be useful for planning a funeral too):</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Timing</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Should the memorial coincide with unveiling their headstone, their internment or scattering of the ashes?</li>
<li>Consider specific dates, like a birthday or anniversary, or set a new date for marking their life every year.</li>
<li>Could you come together to plant a tree instead?</li>
<li>Is there a time of year that feels special? If you want to host the service outside, don’t let the weather ruin your plans!</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Tone and structure</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Think about what you want from the memorial. Was the funeral difficult, too formal or not reflective of your person? Did many people not make it?</li>
<li>Even a celebratory day can be emotional and you might feel extra pressure if you’re leading everything. Ask a confident friend or relative or <a href="https://www.uksoc.com/celebrant-training-courses/what-is-a-celebrant/">engage a celebrant </a>to help you lead the event instead. </li>
<li>Was the person you are commemorating quite formal, or more relaxed? Let this guide who you invite, tributes, music, dress code and venue. </li>
<li>Do you want a more formal memorial like a funeral, with a eulogy and tributes?</li>
<li>For a relaxed event, gather people together over drinks, dinner or a picnic. </li>
<li>Do something completely different - a hike, a road trip or a gig that your person would have liked. There is no right or wrong way to do this.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Venue and decorations</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A memorial doesn’t need to be sombre - let your loved one’s personality guide you. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Hold it anywhere that feels meaningful - at home, in a garden or the woods, a  favourite park, beach or restaurant.</li>
<li>Can you put up pictures and decorations in the venue, play music, make speeches or do a slideshow, with the privacy and time you need?</li>
<li>Decorate using their favourite colour or flags from their favourite sports team (avoid plastic and take your rubbish with you if you’re outdoors).</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Speeches and tributes</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Do you want speeches or tributes, prepared ahead of the ceremony or spontaneous?</li>
<li>Inviting different speakers can help build up a colourful picture of your person.</li>
<li>Tributes can include a short video, a photo slideshow, singing or live music, lighting candles, digging a hole for a tree together - be as creative as you like.</li>
<li>Create a picture wall, message board or memory book and invite people to contribute.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Rituals</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Memorials tend to be non-religious, without prayers. Something simple like lighting candles, playing music or passing the urn at an internment can feel very poignant. </li>
<li>Create your own ritual - ask everyone to wear something that reminds them of your person or share an activity that feels meaningful, like cooking together, sewing a quilt, or singing.</li>
<li>Bring photo albums to help guests break the ice and share memories.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Music</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Music is great for setting the tone. Create a playlist for when people arrive and after the ceremony, to accompany a slideshow or video, or for quiet reflection during the ceremony. </li>
<li>Choose music that brings you comfort and reflects the person you are honouring.</li>
<li>Music can tell a story; play tracks to chart your loved one’s life and explain the meaning afterwards. </li>
<li>Set up a shared online playlist and invite guests to contribute special tracks.</li>
<li>Invite talented guests to play music or sing - this can be a nice way for children to contribute.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Food and drink</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>UK receptions are often held in places serving alcohol. Decide if this feels right for your memorial. </li>
<li>Do you want a sit down meal, a buffet or canapés? Consider your budget and the tone. Could guests bring a dish that they or your person loved to share?</li>
<li>What food did your person love? If they loved desserts, why not just serve desserts - what a treat!</li>
<li>Afternoon tea can be a nice option, perhaps with bubbly as a toast? </li>
<li>For a picnic, ask everyone to bring their own food and drink.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Invitations</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This isn’t a wedding so an email will do fine. You could include a picture of your person, plus:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Details about the ceremony, location, timings, parking/transportation, what to expect including tone and dress code, and any contributions towards food and drink, photos, messages and music for a shared playlist.</li>
<li>You can create simple designs and layouts using <a href="https://www.canva.com/q/pro/?v=13&amp;country=uk&amp;utm_source=google_sem&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=REV_UK_EN_CanvaPro_Branded_Tier1_Core_EM&amp;utm_term=REV_UK_EN_CanvaPro_Branded_Tier1_Canva_EM&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwybD0BRDyARIsACyS8msuC8q_LNwAvAxzrilyJFQGPkRkB70IgAsF9VTHcz0Y0BvADik0YdwaAk6JEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Canva</a>.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whatever you decide, the most important thing is to feel that you are memorialising your loved one in a meaningful way that brings you and your family comfort as you navigate life without them.</p>

		What grieving families can gain from therapy

<p>When relatives go into therapy or grief counselling together after a bereavement, it can help everybody discover precious pieces of their family’s life and heritage, says psychotherapist Anh Doan. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What are the signs that therapy could work for my family?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s all about communication. When we’re hurting after a bereavement, we often act like wounded children and forget being adults. People start arguing over petty things and judging each other, asking: ‘Why didn’t they send flowers or a card?’ or ‘Why did they put a happy picture of themselves on Instagram’?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The family dynamic also changes when someone dies. For example, if mum was the one we’d all seek comfort from and rely on, we might want dad to play that role when she dies. And when he can’t, we get angry. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the person who died wasn’t very emotionally present, we might also realise we didn’t know them very well. That can leave us with a horrific feeling that we’ve lost something precious – important pieces of our family’s puzzle. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How can grieving relatives benefit from doing therapy together?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When people die we can be left with lots of questions. Family therapists can facilitate important conversations that help relatives learn from each other, open up the photo albums and share precious stories. It’s a bit like digging for old coins and vases – it helps us discover the roots of our lives.</p>

<p><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/grieving-different-religions/">Culture plays a big part</a>, especially for new generations. If your grandad was from Jamaica and now you’re a person of colour in the UK, you might realise you never got to ask him how it was to come here in the 1960s. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the relationship was terrible or the person who died hurt you, we can ask what you’d like to say to the person who has passed away and explore how to best support you now. This can help close old doors and open new ones. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During this process people start to see life differently and relate better to each other, as well as to the person we’ve lost.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How can I encourage my relatives to join me in therapy?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s a stigma around mental health, but if you put it into physical injury terms people are often prepared to help. If your brother or daughter broke their ankle you’d be the first to call an ambulance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With bereavement, sometimes all we can see is a grumpy or angry person, but they are in pain. And grief can trigger depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/grief-and-trauma/">complex trauma</a>. So we need to give each other a hand emotionally too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s also about bonding - a chance to connect with your heritage, your inner self, and your family. In this culture we often hide behind closed doors when we feel vulnerable, but we still crave being together. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Family therapy is about everyone working together towards a common goal. People often agree to come when they see that everyone will gain. We always establish firm boundaries to make sure everyone respects and listens to each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What are the main differences between individual and family therapy for grief?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Systemic or family therapy focuses on how people see themselves within a wider dynamic. Even twins are different in terms of how they perceive their roles. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For family grief counselling or therapy to work, everybody needs to commit to the same goal. It is a massive investment – time-wise, emotionally and financially – and a luxury because you usually have to pay privately. It’s much more complex than individual therapy but that doesn’t mean you can’t achieve it. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sessions last 60-90 minutes with a maximum of four people, usually immediate family. We can be flexible, for example, an individual might prefer to come alone before the rest of the family joins in. You also need a therapist robust enough to hold it together. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now with Covid, things can feel worse for people who are grieving, isolated and alone. But working on Skype and Zoom is working well, especially for families that are spread out across different countries.</p>

		Finding your loved one's pensions
		https://untanglegrief.com/finding-lost-pensions/
		Wed, 11 Aug 2021 11:38:55 +0000
		creativebrains01
		https://untanglegrief.com/?p=302
		
		<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the average UK citizen has six jobs in their lifetime, keeping track of a pension or multiple pension schemes can prove difficult. This article will help you locate any potential lost pension accounts. If you think you have all the accounts, click <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/claiming-pensions-after-a-loss">here</a> for more information on accessing the pensions your loved one held.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Is the pension lost?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before 1988, it was not a legal requirement for employers to automatically enrol employees into pension schemes. Therefore, if you cannot find pension records for a job your loved one held, they may have not been eligible, or had their contributions refunded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>If they left their job before April 1975, it is likely that the contributions would have been refunded, or that they wouldn't have been entitled to any pension benefits from the scheme.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>If they left their job between April 1975 - April 1988, your loved one may have been part of a pension scheme, providing that they had worked at the company for at least five years. If they left before the five years had passed, it is likely any contributions would have been refunded. </li>
<li>If your loved one left their job after April 1988, they may have a pension if they worked there for more than two years. If not, any contributions may have been refunded. </li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Tracking down a lost pension</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most pension providers send a statement every year. Look through your loved one’s paperwork to see if they kept any of these documents. If you can’t find this, there are few ways in which you can find out whether they had a pension. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Contact the pension provider </h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you know your loved one held a pension with a certain provider but you can’t find any further details, contacting the provider directly may provide you with some answers, including the value of the pension pot and whether your loved one nominated a recipient for any death benefits.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Contact them with as many details as you can provide, including:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Your loved one’s National Insurance Number</li>
<li>Their date of birth</li>
<li>An account number (if known)</li>
<li>The date the pension was set up (if known)</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Contact your loved one’s previous employer</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you don’t know which pension provider your loved one had an account with, their former employer should have the answer to this. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Contact their former employer with the following:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Their name and date of birth</li>
<li>Their National Insurance Number</li>
<li>The dates your loved one started and stopped working their (if known)</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is also good to find out whether the pension plan was a defined benefit or defined contribution plan, as this may affect your eligibility to access your loved one’s pension. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Contact the Pension Tracing Service</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re struggling to find the answers, the Pension Tracing Service is a free government service that searches a database of over 200,000 workplace pension schemes to find the details you need. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can call them on 08007310193, or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-pension-contact-details">start an application online</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Other places to try:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.uar.co.uk/">Unclaimed Assets Register</a> - this only covers a small number of pensions, and there is a £25 charge to start a search. This service will be decommissioned on 31/08/22.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://policydetective.co.uk/">Policy Detective website</a> - this is a free service but requires that you know the name of the company that provided your loved one’s pension. </li>
</ul>

		Claiming your loved one's pensions

		<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You may be able to claim your loved one's pensions depending on your loved one’s age, your relationship to them and the type of pension account that they held. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>State Pensions</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Accessing a State Pension should be done within the first 12 months after your loved one’s death. Often state pensions will stop being paid after the person dies, but in some cases a spouse or civil partner can inherit some of the pension.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol>
<li>Notify the Pensions Service that your loved one has died. This can be done via the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/after-a-death/organisations-you-need-to-contact-and-tell-us-once">Tell Us Once</a> service that notifies all government organisations, or by calling the Pensions Service helpline on 0800 731 0469.</li>
</ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":2} -->
<ol start="2">
<li>Assess whether you can claim your loved one’s pension. This can <strong>only</strong> be done by a <strong>spouse or civil partner</strong>. You can contact Gov’s Pension Service to check what you can claim (you may be able to claim extra benefits if you meet the criteria): <a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-pension-service">https://www.gov.uk/contact-pension-service</a></li>
</ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What you get/how you claim depends on whether you reached State Pension age before or after 6 April 2016.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>If you reached State Pension age before 6 April 2016</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>You’ll get any State Pension based on your husband, wife or civil partner’s National Insurance contribution when you claim your own pension.</li>
<li>You will not get it if you remarry or form a new civil partnership before you reach State Pension age.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>If you reached State Pension age on or after 6 April 2016</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>You’ll receive the ‘new State Pension’ and you may be able to inherit an extra payment on top of your pension</li>
<li>You can check your eligibility here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-through-partner">https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-through-partner</a></li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Personal or workplace pensions</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Accessing a Workplace Pension should be done within the first 12 months since your loved one’s death.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol>
<li>Check through their paperwork to see if they had a workplace pension scheme</li>
</ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":2} -->
<ol start="2">
<li>Contact the pension provider to find out how much they had and what to do next</li>
</ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"start":3} -->
<ol start="3">
<li>Find out if the pension is either a Defined Contribution pension or a Defined Benefit pension. If you are unsure what type of pension they had, you can contact their employer to ask. Read more about how to do this here [link to other article]</li>
</ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Defined Contribution pensions </h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Defined contribution pensions, also known as a ‘money purchase’ scheme, allows an individual to build up a pension pot whilst in employment. This pot is used to pay out an income once they reach retirement age, based on how much the person and/or their employer contributed, and how much this pot has grown. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your loved one had not yet retired, any beneficiaries can usually withdraw all the money as a lump sum and set up a guaranteed income (annuity), or set up a flexible retirement income (drawdown). This might not always be possible, so check the conditions of the pension. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Different tax rules apply when inheriting a defined contribution pension, and it depends on whether the person died before age 75. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>If your loved one died before age 75:</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Beneficiaries won’t pay any tax if the money is claimed and transferred within two years. </li>
<li>If your loved one received income from a single life annuity, in most cases this will stop. The only exception is if there was a ‘guaranteed period’ attached to the annuity. If there was, the annuity will continue to be paid tax-free until the end of the guarantee period, which is usually five or 10 years. </li>
<li>If it was a joint life annuity (i.e. with a spouse or civil partner), income will continue to be paid to the survivor tax-free until they die. However this is usually at a reduced rate of half the amount. </li>
<li>Any money taken out of the pension scheme before your loved one died, or any investments bought with any cash from the pension scheme, will count as part of the deceased’s estate and thus may be subject to Inheritance Tax.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>If your loved one died after age 75:</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>If the person received income from a single life annuity, this will stop unless there was a ‘guaranteed period’. If this applies, the income will be paid to the beneficiaries until the end of the guaranteed period. Income tax will be deductible from these payments.</li>
<li>If it was a joint annuity, it will continue to be paid to the surviving spouse or civil partner, but income tax will apply.</li>
<li>If any money was taken as a lump sum, as an income from a flexi-access drawdown scheme, or from any untouched pension pot, it will be added to any other income the beneficiary receives, and taxed in the normal way.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Defined benefit pensions</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A defined benefit pension pays an individual an income based on their salary, and how long they worked for their employer. These are less common, and tend to only apply to public sector or older workplace schemes. Each scheme is different, and any money paid out to any beneficiaries will be outlined in the rules of the pension scheme. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This type of pension often pays out a ‘dependant’s pension’ to anyone financially dependent on the deceased, including a spouse or civil partner,  a partner the deceased wasn’t married to or in a civil partnership with, and/or child(ren) under 23. This payment is a percentage of what your loved one was getting, or would have received if they had not yet reached retirement age. This income is often taxable. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the pension was a small amount, it can often be paid in a lump sum. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your loved one had not retired: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>The majority of schemes will pay out a lump sum, often between two and four times of the deceased’s salary. </li>
<li>If your loved one was under age 75 at their time of death, this payment is tax-free.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your loved one had retired: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>A reduced pension will often continue to be paid to a spouse, civil partner or other dependent until they die.</li>
<li>You can check this with the pension scheme or provider.</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Lifetime allowance</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the total value of your loved one’s pension contributions is more than the lifetime allowance, you might have to pay tax on any money you inherit from this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The lifetime allowance usually changes every year, but it is frozen at £1,073,100 until 2026.</p>

		What to do with your loved one's social media accounts when they die
		https://untanglegrief.com/managing-social-media-accounts-after-a-loss/
		Wed, 11 Aug 2021 11:57:14 +0000

		<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Knowing what to do with a loved one’s social media accounts when a loved one dies can be tricky. Some find the ghostly notifications deeply upsetting, whilst others like to re-read old messages and posts to remind themselves of precious moments. Some people even use the direct messaging function as a way to write down the things they wish they had said whilst that person had been alive. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s no right or wrong way to handle the online accounts of your loved one, but there are options. In this article, we’ll guide you through all the pros and cons of each choice, along with a step-by-step guide on how to take action for each account. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Keep, delete or memorialise</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A lot of social media accounts will give you three options: Keep the page as it is, delete the account altogether or turn the page into a memorial of your loved one. Each comes with its own advantages and disadvantages, and it’s wise to talk to other members of the family so you’re all comfortable with whatever you decide to do. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Keep: </strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some platforms such as Facebook will keep accounts open indefinitely, whilst others, such as Twitter, will automatically delete accounts after periods of inactivity (in the case of Twitter, this is six months). Keeping the account open allows you to avoid the issue altogether, but it can cause the platforms to send you notifications encouraging you to engage with them, or your loved one may be mistaken for being alive by old friends who may not have heard of their passing. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Delete: </strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Deleting the account altogether means that they can’t be found online and old posts can’t be scrutinised by others. Deleting affords the deceased a certain level of privacy, but it will delete all of their posts, photos or messages, so doing this can prove painful to friends and family. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>Memorialising: </strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the page, it becomes clear that the person has passed. On Facebook, for example, the phrase ‘Remembering’ is inserted before the person’s name, and it keeps all the person’s content on the page, whilst removing birthday reminders and taking them out of searches. Facebook even allows users to appoint ‘legacy contacts’. These are people who can take over the account once Facebook has been alerted, pin a message to the top of the page and allow the page to accept friend requests. The page effectively becomes a memorial book for people to post messages, which some can find very comforting. It can also be an effective way of letting a lot of people know about your loved one’s passing, especially if you’re having trouble tracking down old friends, or are finding the process of contacting old colleagues or acquaintances very painful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here, we cover the following social media accounts and what you can do with them when someone dies:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Instagram</li>
<li>WhatsApp</li>
<li>Snapchat</li>
<li>YouTube</li>
<li>LinkedIn</li>
</ul>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How to deal with a loved one’s Facebook account when they die</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In this easy to follow step-by-step guide, we’ll show you how to contact Facebook and action whatever you have chosen. Any friend or family member connected with the deceased can do this. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol>
<li>Gather the deceased person’s full name on Facebook, their profile URL and a copy of their death certificate. </li>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How to deal with a loved one’s Twitter account when they die</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here, we’ll show you how to deactivate an account on Twitter. Twitter doesn’t currently allow you to memorialise a page like Facebook does. Also, it’s worth noting that Twitter will automatically deactivate an account after six months of inactivity. To deactivate a Twitter account, you must be a person authorised to act on behalf of the estate or a verified immediate family member. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol>
<li>Gather the deceased person’s full name on Twitter and their Twitter handle.</li>
<li>Complete this form: <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/forms/account-access/deactivate-or-close-account/deactivate-account-for-deceased">https://help.twitter.com/en/forms/account-access/deactivate-or-close-account/deactivate-account-for-deceased</a> </li>
<li>Twitter will email you instructions on how to send more detailed information to them. </li>
<li>Email Twitter information about the deceased, a copy of your ID and a copy of the death certificate. </li>
</ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How to deal with a loved one’s Instagram account when they die</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instagram - like Facebook - will allow you to either memoralise or delete your loved one’s account. Once you’ve decided, you’ll need to run through the following steps:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol>
<li>Gather the deceased’s full name, Instagram username, proof of death (e.g. aneg an obituary or news article) and the date they passed away. </li>
<li>Complete this form to memorialise the account: <a href="https://help.instagram.com/contact/452224988254813">https://help.instagram.com/contact/452224988254813</a> </li>
<li>To delete the account, you’ll also need to prove that you’re an immediate family member. To do this, you’ll need a copy of the deceased person’s birth certificate, their death certificate or proof of authority under local law that you are the lawful representative of the deceased person, or his/her estate. </li>
<li>Complete this form to delete the account: <a href="https://help.instagram.com/contact/1474899482730688">https://help.instagram.com/contact/1474899482730688</a> </li>
</ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How to deal with a loved one’s WhatsApp account when they die</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With WhatsApp, you can only delete the account if you have access to the deceased person’s phone. It’s worth remembering that by deleting the account, you will delete all messages, voice notes and photos that have been sent between your loved one and their friends or family. A lot of special memories could be lost. If you choose to delete their account, follow the instructions below. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol>
<li>Open the WhatsApp app on the deceased person’s phone.</li>
<li>Go to Settings. Select ‘Delete Account’. </li>
<li>Enter the deceased person’s number when asked. </li>
<li>If you wish, you can select your reason for deleting the account from the drop down menu. </li>
<li>Select ‘Delete my account’. </li>
</ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How to deal with a loved one’s Snapchat account when they die</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To delete a Snapchat account, you’ll need to know the username and password for the account. Anyone with these details can delete the account. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol>
<li>Log in to the account portal and type in the username and password of the account you’d like to delete. </li>
<li>The account will be deactivated for the first 30 days. </li>
<li>After that, the account, along with all the Snaps, Chats and Stories will be permanently deleted. </li>
</ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How to deal with a loved one’s YouTube account when they die</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>YouTube only allows you to delete a YouTube account, and not to memorialise it. If your loved one was a content creator on YouTube, by deleting the account, you will delete all the videos they produced. It may be worth checking that you have these on other storage systems such as hard drives or cloud storage. To delete a YouTube account, you’ll need to be an immediate family member or a legal representative.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol>
<li>Submit a request to delete the account by visiting this support page: <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/troubleshooter/6357590?hl=en">https://support.google.com/accounts/troubleshooter/6357590?hl=en</a> </li>
<li>Select ‘Close the account of a deceased user’.</li>
<li>Enter their name, email address, details of a relative or legal representative, their date of death and a scan of your ID and a scan of their death certificate. </li>
</ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How to deal with a loved one’s LinkedIn account when they die</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>LinkIn, like Facebook, has a function that allows you to nominate a legacy contact who can close their account if they know the person has passed away. If you know your loved one has done this, ask their legacy contact to enact this. If not, a close friend or family member can get in touch with LinkedIn to get the account deleted. Here’s how: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>Gather the following information: The member name, the URL linked to their profile, your relationship to them, their email address, the date they passed away, their last place of employment and a link to their obituary or a relevant news article if possible. (If not, a scan of a death certificate can be used.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Complete this form to delete the account: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/ts-rdmlp">https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/ask/ts-rdmlp</a></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Finally…</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dealing with this particular area of death admin can be really hard. There are choices to make, you may end up negotiating or even arguing over family members over the best decision regarding these accounts and the paperwork required to get them closed can be tough to pull together. Here are our tips on how to make this process a little easier: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol>
<li>Find a good time to talk with other family members about what to do with each account. </li>
<li>Divide and conquer. If possible, split the accounts up between family members to deal with. </li>
<li>Give yourself time to cry and laugh over the memories stored there, and don’t rush yourself to get this done. Precious memories are often stored online, so try not to make any rash decisions over deleting things. </li>
<li>Take screenshots. If you can’t bear to keep accounts open, sceenshot your favourite posts or memories and store them safely in the cloud. </li>
<li>Know that what you’re feeling is normal. Having to close online accounts is a very new step in death admin, and something we’re all finding our way with. Reach out to others who are in the same boat, either by speaking to friends and family, or by joining one of <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/sign-up">Untangle’s weekly support groups</a> or online events.</li>
</ol>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you’ve lost someone you love, the Christmas holidays can seem far from the happiest time of the year. And grief at Christmas can feel particularly hard. From making new traditions to simply surviving in one piece, <strong>here are our 24 tips for getting through the festive season after a bereavement:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. Talk about your grief at Christmas</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’ve recently lost a close family member or friend, this Christmas will inevitably be different. Before you make plans, try talking about the fact that it might be really hard this year. That way others will feel that it’s OK to be sad and there’s no pressure to put on a brave face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>2. Keep things flexible</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Family relationships often get strained around Christmas, and if you’re coping with grief, you might feel extra anxious about getting together. Be open about your own needs and flexible around other people’s. If you can’t face organising a meal or visiting relatives, maybe a family walk or video call could work? Likewise, if someone really needs company, explore ways to help them feel supported.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>3. Look after yourself</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We all handle bereavement in <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/coping-with-bereavement/">different ways</a>, and the festive season can bring back memories that intensify your feelings. To lessen the physical effects of losing a loved one and look after your mental health, stick to a basic everyday routine: Get up, eat regularly, get some daylight and exercise, and keep in touch with people around you.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>4. Limit alcohol</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>T’is the season to be boozing – but overindulging to dull your feelings after a bereavement can make you feel a lot worse, and lead to arguments, depression, even addiction. If you’re drinking too much, see point 3, and <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/alcohol-support/">ask for help</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>5. Do it differently<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Christmas traditions can seem meaningless when your loved one isn’t there to share them. If something doesn’t bring you joy, don’t do it. It’s OK to not write 37 Christmas cards or cover the house in multicoloured twinkling reindeer - motivation after losing a loved one to participate in festive activities can be hard to find. Go away somewhere new, curl up on the sofa, or skip the celebrations completely. The people who love you will understand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>6. Remember your loved one</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are many ways to <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/remembering-a-loved-one/">keep your loved one’s memory alive</a> at Christmas. For example, light a candle by their photo or grave, decorate a bauble - or the whole house - in their honour, serve their favourite food, or buy something they would have loved and give it to someone who really needs it.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>7. Make new traditions</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re ready, try creating new traditions that suit your life now. If turkey was never really your thing, maybe now is the time for steak and chips, sushi or a slap-up veggie meal? Or donating to charity instead of buying presents and inviting the neighbours around for mince pies.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>8. Talk about them</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mentioning people we’ve lost can feel comforting. Make a toast to them, or to ‘absent friends’, on Christmas Day. And if it feels right, watch old video clips or look through photos together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>9. Lend a hand</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes focusing on other people’s needs can give you a break from your own grief. If you’re feeling up to it, <a href="https://www.crisis.org.uk/get-involved/volunteer/">offer a helping hand</a> to someone else who is struggling – it is Christmas after all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>10. Express yourself</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you’re missing them terribly, don’t keep it all bottled up. Pour it into a letter or Christmas card, paint or draw a favourite memory, belt out a Christmas classic (with or without an audience), talk to someone or <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/sign-up/">join a grief support group</a>. You’ll feel better afterwards.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>11. Reflect on your future</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Try thinking about things you’d like to do in the coming year. From painting your bedroom or joining a choir to starting bereavement counselling or moving house: make a list of things that will make you feel better. You might change your mind, but at least you’ll emerge from Christmas with some ideas for what your future could look like now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>12. It's ok to be ok</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grief can suddenly lift like fog when you forget for a moment that they’re gone<strong>. </strong>If it happens, don’t feel guilty – allow yourself some happiness in the middle of it all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><h3>13 Feel free to decline</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Christmas, we can all feel the pressure to show up, whether that’s physically at parties or emotionally, through acts of giving. If that all sounds too draining, feel free to decline. Your friends and family will understand.</span></p>
<h3>14 Keep it low-key and stress-free</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paring back Christmas can feel right for some people, especially in those first few Christmases after losing someone. Opt for Secret Santa instead of </span><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/grief-gift-guide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">buying presents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for everyone, and make a donation to your loved one’s favourite charity instead of buying and sending Christmas cards.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>15 Attend a local memorial service</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many faiths hold memorial services at Christmas for those we have lost in the years past. Being with others who are grieving at this time of year, and </span><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/grieving-different-religions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sharing that loss in a faith setting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, can prove very healing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>16 Find new ways to keep busy</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people find throwing themselves into Christmas is a nice way to keep themselves busy and their mind off their grief. Try making from scratch what you would have made yourself: mince pies, cards, presents, gravy… The festive season offers plenty of extra work if that’s what you need.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>17 Indulge in a little self care</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you lose a loved one, it can be easy to adopt a care taking role - looking after everyone around you without taking care of yourself. Set aside an evening or a day in your calendar to do just that. There are lots of self care ideas online from </span><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/the-30-best-books-on-grief/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spending an afternoon reading</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to batch cooking some of your favourite healthy meals to freeze for those nights when you can’t be bothered to cook.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>18 Dabble in some mindful activities</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anxiety is a very common symptom of grief and feeling alone. Slow down racing minds by doing something mindful with your hands instead. From colouring Christmas cards to sewing your own stockings, there’s a wealth of calming crafts to discover.</span></p>
<h3>19 Get something for yourself</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no harm in treating yourself to something this Christmas too that you feel might help you with your grief. From a cookery class to keep busy to </span><a href="https://join.untanglegrief.com/therapy/?utm_source=article&amp;utm_medium=seo&amp;utm_campaign=surviving-christmas"><strong>therapy or counselling</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to air your feelings, buying yourself something says yourself that you matter this Christmas too.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>20 Connect with nature</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting amongst nature improves our overall wellbeing by reducing feelings of stress and sadness, and Christmas offers us lots of opportunities to connect with the season of winter. Woodland walks collecting foliage to bring indoors and dress the house with is a longstanding tradition and, if you’re grieving, this can prove impactful.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>21 Give journaling a go</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You needn’t treat yourself to a fancy new notebook to give this powerful grief tool a go. Document how you’re feeling, write down the things you wish you’d said to your loved one and jot down all those memories you have of them as they pop up. It’s a great way to watch the shape of your grief change over time and Christmas is a great time to start.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>22 Know that grief brain fog is real&nbsp;</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve found yourself forgetting why you walked into a room or have found your car keys in the fridge, do not worry. Grief has a way of fogging up the brain and affecting the short term memory. It disappears in time, but be mindful of the fact that this can cause more problems than usual at Christmas. Don’t be afraid to keep little lists on your phone of presents you need to buy, things you need to do and even of who got you which present so you can thank people properly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>23 Give a meaningful gift</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re sharing Christmastime with people also grieving your loved one, a gift </span><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/remembering-a-loved-one/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that reminds them of that person</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be well received. Some sewists will turn your loved one’s clothes into memorial blankets, quilts or even tree decorations. Or you could simply purchase their favourite books and records and give them out, explaining to each of them why the person you lost loved that item so much.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>24 Ignore Christmas altogether</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it all seems too much, you don’t have to embark on festivities at all. Christmas is, after all, just another day. Shut the curtains, order in food and find a new television series to get your teeth stuck into.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To meet others who are also going through grief, join </span><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/register-untangle/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Untangle’s free online peer support groups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.samaritans.org/"><b>The Samaritans</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides a free confidential listening service 24/7, all year, with no judgement or pressure.</span></p></p>

<h2>1. A Grief Observed by C.S. Lewis</h2>
The Chronicles of Narnia author C.S. Lewis had been married to his wife for four blissful years. When she died of cancer in 1960, he found himself alone, inconsolable in his grief. In this intimate journal, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Grief-Observed-Faber-Paperbacks-ebook/dp/B009R66YUI?crid=IJMESZEBTJBU&amp;keywords=a+grief+observed&amp;qid=1678360855&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=a+grief+%2Cdigital-text%2C83&amp;sr=1-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=untanglegrief-21&amp;linkId=01d4dfb37bf6540ff5edee4b74f4e0d8&amp;language=en_GB&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">A Grief Observed</a> chronicles the aftermath of the bereavement and mourning with blazing honesty. He grapples with a crisis of religious faith, navigating hope, rage, despair, and love - but eventually regains his bearings, finding his way back to life.
<h2>2. A Half Baked Idea by Olivia Potts</h2>
At the moment her mother died, grief pushed Olivia into the kitchen. She came home from her job as a criminal barrister miserable and tired, and baked soda bread, pizza, and chocolate banana cake.

She found comfort in jams and solace in pies, and what began as a distraction from grief became a way of building a life outside grief, a way of surviving, and making sense of her life without her mum. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Half-Baked-Idea-courtroom-Cordon-ebook/dp/B07KMR6PT8?crid=1U3WMD5OSB3RI&amp;keywords=a+half+baked+idea&amp;qid=1678360913&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=a+half+baked+idea%2Cdigital-text%2C79&amp;sr=1-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=untanglegrief-21&amp;linkId=9cd3bf67044f13824e96ccdcc5c0ffaa&amp;language=en_GB&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">A Half Baked Idea</a> follows Olivia’s journey through her grief, whilst studying at Le Cordon Bleu - despite not being able to cook!
<h2>3. All At Sea by Decca Aitkenhead</h2>
On a hot still morning on a beautiful beach in Jamaica, Decca Aitkenhead's life changed forever. Her four-year-old boy was paddling peacefully at the water’s edge when a wave pulled him out to sea. Her partner, Tony, swam out and saved their son’s life then drowned before her eyes. Exploring race and redemption, privilege and prejudice, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/All-at-Sea-Decca-Aitkenhead-ebook/dp/B015DLWSUU?crid=Q7MHGFFJXKQ9&amp;keywords=all+at+sea&amp;qid=1678360946&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sprefix=all+at+sea%2Cdigital-text%2C84&amp;sr=1-2&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=untanglegrief-21&amp;linkId=25d31b199f80ab48d37d9548b3003a42&amp;language=en_GB&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">All At Sea</a> is a remarkable story of love and loss, of how one couple changed each other's lives and of what a sudden death can do to the people who survive.
<h2>4. Being Mortal by Atul Gawande</h2>

With his trademark mix of perceptiveness and sensitivity, Gawande outlines a story that crosses the globe, as he examines his experiences as a surgeon and those of his patients and family, and learns to accept the limits of what he can do.
<h2>5. Bird Therapy by Joe Harkness</h2>
When Joe Harkness suffered a breakdown in 2013, he tried all the things his doctor recommended: medication helped, counselling was enlightening, and mindfulness grounded him. But nothing came close to nature, particularly birds.

The positive change in Joe's wellbeing was so profound that he started a blog to record his experience. Three years later he became a spokesperson for the benefits of birdwatching, spreading the word everywhere from Radio 4 to Downing Street. In this groundbreaking book filled with practical advice, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bird-Therapy-Joe-Harkness/dp/1783528982?crid=1XD271K0FKH3S&amp;keywords=bird+therapy&amp;qid=1678361027&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=bird+therapy%2Cstripbooks%2C81&amp;sr=1-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=untanglegrief-21&amp;linkId=ba04534d8b15fa45384f6d93e4b86b94&amp;language=en_GB&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Bird Therapy</a> explains the impact that birdwatching had on his life, and invites the reader to discover these extraordinary effects for themselves.
<h2>6. Cheer the F**k up by Jack Rooke</h2>
Part comedic memoir, part advice guide, this book is a fresh and timely take on a huge issue very close to Jack’s heart – in 2015, while working as an ambassador for a male mental health charity, he lost one of his best friends to suicide.

Taking you on a journey through his life and experiences with grief, sexuality, depression and more, Jack offers his own frank and powerful advice on how best to have meaningful conversations about a loved one’s state of mind. Hilarious and heart-breaking in equal measure, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cheer-Up-Save-your-Friend/dp/1529108241?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1678361068&amp;sr=1-3&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=untanglegrief-21&amp;linkId=a0d74cf6b1cb67e0bcf895fb8c0e25d0&amp;language=en_GB&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Cheer the F**K Up</a> will definitely make you laugh and might just make you cry, but it could also help save a life.

A profound exploration of the love between siblings, it will make you laugh, cry, and wonder if that possum on the fence is really your brother's spirit animal.
<h2>8. Finding Joy by Gary Andrews</h2>
When his wife, Joy, died very suddenly, a daily drawing became the way Gary Andrews dealt with his grief.

In a moment of despair, the family are visited by Crow - and they are unsure whether he is an antagonist, a trickster, a babysitter - or indeed a healer.

The bird becomes attached to the family in the depths of their grief, and promises he will stay until they no longer need his guidance. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Grief-Thing-Feathers-Max-Porter/dp/0571327230?crid=U1T170GXEKFB&amp;keywords=grief+is+the+thing+with+feathers&amp;qid=1678361211&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=grief+is%2Cstripbooks%2C87&amp;sr=1-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=untanglegrief-21&amp;linkId=6d63e7696db797ef33868f420e2eb75b&amp;language=en_GB&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Grief Is the Thing with Feathers</a> is full of humour and emotional depth, and the truths about grief will stay with you for a long time.

<h2>13. It's OK That You're Not OK: Meeting Grief and Loss in a Culture That Doesn't Understand by Megan Devine</h2>
Megan Devine explores why our culture treats grief like something to be cured as quickly as possible, even though it is ‘a natural and sane response to loss.’ Devine has experienced grief from both sides - as a therapist and also as a woman after losing her partner in a tragic accident.

Using her experience, she writes truthfully about love, loss and healing, and debunks the myth of returning to a ‘normal’ life - instead preferring to invite you to build life alongside your grief. A mixture of stories, tips, research and mindfulness, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Its-That-Youre-Not-Understand/dp/1622039076?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1678361392&amp;sr=1-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=untanglegrief-21&amp;linkId=7509cb23f66ffd5d38b9e7a01af872df&amp;language=en_GB&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">It’s Ok That You’re Not Ok</a> offers a unique guide to the experience we will all face at one stage or another in our lives.

Highly recommended for those in the first few months of their loss, this book supports readers through the pain and gives them permission to explore all their feelings. The main message is that everyone grieves differently, but knowing more about the theory can help you feel less alone and reflect upon how far you’ve come.
<h2>15. Man’s Search For Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl</h2>
Frankl, a Holocaust survivor and prominent Viennese psychiatrist, tells his story and observations on the ways both he and others coped in Auschwitz, noticing that often those who provided comfort and showed kindness towards others survived for the longest.

He notes that even when everything is taken away from us, we still have the ability to choose how we behave and react. He concludes that humankind’s biggest wish is to search for a sense of purpose. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mans-Search-Meaning-classic-Holocaust/dp/1844132390?crid=2M0EEXT5DJP55&amp;keywords=mans+search+for+meaning&amp;qid=1678361450&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=mans%2Cstripbooks%2C86&amp;sr=1-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=untanglegrief-21&amp;linkId=98f73df95dfa6fd5af24c438de273e87&amp;language=en_GB&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Man's Search For Meaning</a> gives us a way to transcend our pain and suffering, and find reasons to keep on living.
<h2>16. Modern Loss: Candid Conversation about Grief. Beginners Welcome by Rebecca Soffer and Gabrielle Birkner</h2>

Taken from insights and stories from the Modern Loss community, this book changes the dialogue around grief with wise and funny anecdotes that help the reader to cry, laugh, identify and grieve, and most importantly find empathy.

<h2>17. Not That Kind of Love by Clare and Greg Wise</h2>
Based on Clare Wise’s blog that she started after receiving a cancer diagnosis in 2013, this book follows the ups and downs of the last few years of her life. Full of candour and warmth rather than despair, Clare’s positive energy and dynamic personality fill every page.

In the later stages when she became too weak to type, her brother Greg took over, and the book offers poignant thoughts of the beauty of life, and the necessity of talking about death. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/That-Kind-Love-Clare-Wise/dp/1786488965?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1678361508&amp;sr=1-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=untanglegrief-21&amp;linkId=024d6720176e09b250924fd4bfb8c441&amp;language=en_GB&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Not That Kind of Love</a> focuses on celebrating the small things, such as wearing ‘matching socks as you leave the house in the morning’ - and anything above that is a bonus in the act of living.

A famous and celebrated psychological study from the late twentieth century, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Grief-Grieving-Finding-Meaning-Through/dp/1471139883?crid=3TLYDYHQK9YDA&amp;keywords=on+grief+and+grieving+elizabeth+kubler+ross&amp;qid=1678361541&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=On+Grief+and+Grieving%2Cstripbooks%2C88&amp;sr=1-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=untanglegrief-21&amp;linkId=434c3d5ad90796ee72ac50c597934c8b&amp;language=en_GB&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">On Grief and Grieving</a> came out of Dr Elisabeth Kubler-Ross’ renowned seminar on life and death.

<h2>19. Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy by Sheryl Sandberg and Adam Grant</h2>
Sheryl Sandberg lost her husband Dave suddenly in 2015, aged only forty-eight. The lives of her family were turned upside down and she couldn’t imagine finding any joy or meaning again.

When she was talking to her friend about how she felt whilst missing Dave, her friend told her: "Option A is not available. So let's just kick the s*** out of Option B." Sandberg explains that we all face Option B at points in our lives - whether that’s dealing with losing jobs, losing love or losing lives.

<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Option-Adversity-Building-Resilience-Finding/dp/0753548291?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1678361569&amp;sr=1-2&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=untanglegrief-21&amp;linkId=90dfd9ebfa08bd178124479c051e2426&amp;language=en_GB&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Option B</a> mixes Sandberg’s experiences with research findings from Adam Grant and other social scientists, featuring stories from those who overcame hardship - personal and professional. It offers tips on how to deal with hard times in our own lives, and how to help others too. It also looks into pre-traumatic growth, and how we can raise resilient children and create strong communities - to find real joy and love in life.
<h2>20. Signs: The Secret Language of the Universe by Laura Lynne Jackson</h2>

<h2>21. Surviving the Death of a Sibling: Living Through Grief When an Adult Brother or Sister Dies by T.J. Wray</h2>

		What to do When Someone Dies - A Complete Guide

		<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">What to do When Someone Dies</span></h1>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Working out what to do when someone dies can feel overwhelming. There are certain practical tasks that are time-sensitive, but most tasks can wait at least a little while. Knowing what is important to do right away and what you can take off your plate for now, will really help you avoid unnecessary overwhelm. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article I’ll guide you through all of the practical and emotional steps you’ll need to take when a loved one passes with all the resources and information you’ll need. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than trying to get through it all in one go, we recommend taking what you need for now (usually the First Bits to Do and Planning the Funeral sections are all you’ll need to start), and then returning when you’re ready to take on the next set of tasks. </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2>First bits - what to do when someone dies</h2>
<h3><b>Telling work and discussing bereavement leave</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, bereavement leave isn’t a legal requirement for employers in the UK. Most companies do give between 3-5 days paid leave, but this has to be taken from the time of death. If you have a good relationship with your manager and/or you’ve been working at the company for a while, you may be able to request more time off, but this is entirely at your employers discretion. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a number of ways around this restriction:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dependant leave</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compassionate leave</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take holiday leave</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sick leave for mental health  </span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">*We’re working hard to help change the laws around bereavement leave. Grief doesn’t happen on a timeline, and healing almost never happens in just 5 days.*</span>
<h3><b>How to tell government services</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To inform government services requires just 2 things:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/register-offices"><span style="font-weight: 400;">register the death at the local council register</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> office in the area where the death took place. You’ll be given a unique number for the Tell Us Once service.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/after-a-death/organisations-you-need-to-contact-and-tell-us-once"><span style="font-weight: 400;">use Tell Us Once</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a free government service that allows you to report a death to all other government departments.</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you use Tell Us Once, the services notified will include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DWP pensions and benefits</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal tax</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Council tax</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passport</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Driving licence</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blue Badge</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electoral register</span></li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h3><b>A guide on telling others</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have to tell others about the death of a friend or family member, the way in which you deliver the bad news can make all the difference difference. We’ve outlined the main points below:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The where’s and when’s:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If possible, break the news face to face. If not possible - because of distance, for instance, pick up the phone and call them.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure your schedule is clear. It’s best not to rush these things.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choose a safe, comfortable and confidential setting where you won’t be interrupted. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re calling an elderly or vulnerable person, you might want to call them at a time when there’s going to be someone else with them, so they won’t be on their own afterwards.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The what’s:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Writing down what you want to get across can really help you make sure you say what you need to say. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use simple, clear language. Euphemisms like ‘they’re no longer with us’ can be confusing, especially for those with a different first language to you.   </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure they’re seated as the shock of bad news can cause some people to feel faint.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start by letting them know you have bad news as this can prepare them for what’s to come.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As hard and unintuitive as it might be, it’s usually best to avoid easing in. People can tell when something is wrong, so delaying the inevitable only leads to additional stress.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of the delivery, some people will get confused when receiving such shocking and sad news. They may only b able to process a small amount. In these instances, it’s a good idea to check that they understand what’s happened and encourage them to express their feelings.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s usually best to leave discussions of practical things for a separate conversation. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not everyone wants to be held after hearing such news so it’s always best to ask before if they want to be touched. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have to leave but the receiver of the bad news becomes very distressed, it’s a good idea to reach out to someone who can support them in your absence.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visiting or calling lots of people can be emotionally exhausting. If you have a long list of people to call, it’s best to spread it out over a few days or share the calls with someone close. </span></li>
</ul>

<h3><b>How to find the will</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When someone dies, arrangements have to be made to administer their estate. This includes dealing with their house, bank accounts, investments and tax affairs, and ensuring that whatever is left is correctly distributed to those entitled to inherit it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people will </span><a href="https://www.co-oplegalservices.co.uk/making-a-will/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">write a will</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during their lifetime, which is a legal document setting out how they would like their estate to be distributed after they die. The will firstly appoints an executor, who is the individual with the legal authority to administer the estate. The executor may have to obtain a grant of probate to carry out their duties in full. The will then names beneficiaries and sets out what they should inherit from the estate.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the deceased didn't leave a will, or if the will cannot be located, then the estate will be distributed in line with inheritance laws called the </span><a href="https://www.co-oplegalservices.co.uk/probate-solicitors/the-rules-of-intestacy-explained/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rules of intestacy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These rules are strict and may not align with the deceased's wishes. This is why it's so important to establish whether there is a will, and to successfully locate it if so.</span>
<ol>
 	<li><b> Search the house</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first place you should look for the will is in your loved one’s home, as it’s a common place for people to store their will. If you know where they kept paperwork, then this would be a sensible place to start. </span>
<ol start="2">
 	<li><b> Ask their solicitor</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the deceased hired a solicitor to write their will, it is possible that they are storing the will on their behalf. If you know which solicitor they used, give them a ring. Otherwise, call all the local solicitors and see if they ever dealth with your loved one.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The executor is entitled to obtain the will from whoever is storing it. You’ll be asked for the death certificate and proof of your identification. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the solicitor is no longer in business, contact the </span><a href="https://www.sra.org.uk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solicitors Regulation Authority</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This organisation holds records for all currently active and once active solicitors in England and Wales. They’ll have a record of solicitor's practice and will be able to help you find where the will is being stored now.</span>
<ol start="3">
 	<li><b> Ask their bank</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks occasionally store wills on behalf of individuals. If you are the executor of the estate, you could ask your loved one’s bank if they have a copy of the will. You’ll need the deceased’s death certificate and proof of your identification.</span>
<ol start="4">
 	<li><b> Use a company to do a will search</b></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve tried the above 3 strategies to find the will but can’t, there are companies that can carry out searches to locate missing wills on your behalf. These companies will search through will databases that are used by solicitors and will writers all over the country; as well as carrying out a search of the National Wills Register.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, you can also contact the </span><a href="https://www.theprobatedepartment.co.uk/find-the-nearest-probate-registry/the-principal-registry-office-london/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">London Principle Probate Registry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ask if they’re storing the will in their wills storage facility.</span>
<h3></h3>
<h3><b>What to do if there is no will</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve conducted a thorough search for the will, including searching with any solicitors your loved one dealth with, but are unable to find the original document, the estate will be administered by the next of kin under the assumption that the deceased didn’t leave a will - called intestacy. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re unable to find a will of your loved one or only have a copy will, </span><a href="https://www.co-oplegalservices.co.uk/probate-solicitors/request-a-callback/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">contact a probate specialist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get personalised advice.</span>
<h2>Planning the Funeral</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When planning a funeral, </span><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/our-advice-for-planning-a-funeral/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the first thing to consider is whether you want a religious or non-religious funeral service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Anyone can legally conduct a funeral or memorial service, although a member of the clergy will usually officiate a religious ceremony, and a civil celebrant will usually officiate a non-religious ceremony (also known as a humanist ceremony).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The funeral service is followed by either a burial or cremation. Often, the person who has died will have expressed a preference for one or the other when they were alive. If not, you may wish to abide by the religious or cultural beliefs of the deceased.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a special place where you would prefer to remember your loved one, that may influence your decision on whether to choose a burial or cremation. With a burial, there is a grave to visit and maintain. After a cremation, the <a href="/scattering-ashes/">ashes</a> are returned to the family for them to keep at home or scatter at a meaningful location.</span>
<h3><b>Who covers the cost of a funeral?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The estate of the deceased can cover the costs of the funeral. The person responsible for the estate administration (usually named in the Will) will have access to the funds once probate has been completed - a process that can take several months.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A funeral service is usually held within 2-3 weeks of death in the UK, but there can be some delay if a coroner’s inquest or post-mortem is ordered.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This can often mean that the cost of the funeral will have to be paid for by the person in charge of the estate and will get paid back when the probate process is complete. Though, often the entire family chips in and in instances where the estate can cover the costs of the funeral, gets reimbursed. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For more on planning a funeral, </span><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/our-advice-for-planning-a-funeral/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">check out our complete guide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<h3><b>How to write a Eulogy</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, no one can tell you how you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">write your Eulogy nor what it should contain - there is no one size fits all approach to writing a eulogy. The best Eulogies are unique, personal and come from the heart. So instead of telling you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to write, we’ll just tell you how we like to think about eulogy writing. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A eulogy is like a greatest hits album: they have a story arc (beginning, middle, and end); and they cover things like accomplishments, personality traits (and quirks), and memorable stories. Just like with greatest hits, it doesn’t always have to be sunshine, lollipops and rainbows - you can explore the harder parts of your history with your loved one. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe they were always late. Or forever forgetting things. Or really loud. Often this authenticity can make a eulogy even more beautiful and heartfelt - and, in some cases, will have the room roaring with the laughter of acknowledgement. Just try to remember that you’re there to honour the deceased, so feel free to explore the aspects of them that weren’t so great, but maybe through the lens of love and respect.    </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Poems, songs or quotes can alos be a great way to encapsulate a feeling about your loved one. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And a touch we really like, is thanking everyone that’s travelled from all over to be there to honour your loved one.    </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For a more complete guide on how to write a eulogy, </span><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/how-to-write-a-eulogy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">check out this article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your bank, you may be able to do this over the phone, online, by post or in-person at your local branch. As well as freezing the account, the bank will stop sending post addressed to the person who has died. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you are waiting for a ‘grant of representation’ (the legal form that allows you to handle the deceased person’s finances), most banks will still allow you to use funds in the account of the person who has died to cover some immediate expenses related to settling their estate.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you can't find all the deceased's bank, building society or savings accounts, </span><a href="https://www.mylostaccount.org.uk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Lost Account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can find out where they held an account, though it can take up to three months to trace.</span>

<h3><b>Notify the Landlord &amp; Other Tenants</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell the Landlord or local authority if your loved one rented a property. If the property is being rented under a joint contract, the contract becomes the responsibility of the other tenants and rent is still due so if the other tenants don’t already know it’s important to let them know.</span>
<h3></h3>
<h3><b>Notify Insurance: Home</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact your loved one’s home insurance provider with the following information:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your loved one’s name, last address and date of birth</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A certified copy of their death certificate (if you have one at this stage)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policy number</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your own proof of identity, for example, a valid driving license or passport</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The insurer should then guide you through the next steps and advise you of any further details or documentation needed.</span>
<h3><b>Notify Insurance: Car</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact your loved one’s car insurance provider with the following information:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your loved one’s name, last address and date of birth</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A certified copy of their death certificate (if you have one at this stage)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policy number</span></li>

 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your own proof of identity, for example, a valid driving license or passport</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a named driver on the car insurance policy, check with the insurers whether you’re still covered. If you are not, you will need to get a new policy in place.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch out – most policies terminate on the death of the main policy holder and this will leave the car uninsured. Ideally, the car should be parked in private parking instead of on the road.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The provider should then guide you through the next steps and advise you of any further details or documentation needed.</span>
<h2>Money Management</h2>
<h3><b>Check for bereavement benefits</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need to report the death to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), you can telephone the DWP Bereavement Service. They can deal with all the DWP benefits that were being paid to the person who died and check if you are entitled to any benefits. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a helpful calculator for what benefits you're entitled to in the UK: </span><a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/family/benefits-check/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/family/benefits-check/</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also be able to claim a Bereavement Support Payment from the Government, if your husband, wife or civil partner died on or after 6 April 2017. You’re eligible for this if they paid National Insurance contributions for at least 25 weeks, but you must have been under State Pension age and living in the UK when they died. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two types of bereavement benefit payments:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bereavement Support Payment (this used to be called Bereavement allowance) which is an ongoing monthly payment</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A one-off Bereavement Payment which is £2,000 tax-free given once</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>If Your Partner has Died</b></h3>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may be entitled to Income Support or Universal Credit from the Government if your earnings are now below a certain level.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there’s now only one adult living in your property then you are entitled to a 25% discount on your council tax.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Claiming your loved one’s pension</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Accessing a State Pension should be done within the first 12 months after your loved one’s death. Often state pensions will stop being paid after the person dies, but in some cases a spouse or civil partner can inherit some of the pension.</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notify the Pensions Service that your loved one has died. This can be done via the </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/after-a-death/organisations-you-need-to-contact-and-tell-us-once"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell Us Once</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> service that notifies all government organisations, or by calling the Pensions Service helpline on 0800 731 0469.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assess whether you can claim your loved one’s pension. This can </span><b>only</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be done by a </span><b>spouse or civil partner</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can contact Gov’s Pension Service to check what you can claim (you may be able to claim extra benefits if you meet the criteria): </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-pension-service"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.gov.uk/contact-pension-service</span></a></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">What you get/how you claim depends on whether you reached State Pension age before or after 6 April 2016.</span>

<h3></h3>
<h3><b>Claim Life Insurance</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t know if there is a life insurance policy, check the Will, ask their Solicitor or look at their bank statements. You can also visit </span><a href="https://www.uar.co.uk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unclaimed Asset Register</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a database of thousands of life insurance policies, unclaimed pensions, shares, dividends, dormant savings accounts and lottery winnings. It costs £25 to run a search for a life policy.</span>
<h3><b>Pay Off Debts</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When someone dies, the executor of the estate, or the administrator if no will has been left, is responsible for paying any outstanding debts from the estate.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the money and/or assets in the estate won’t pay off all the debts, the debts will be paid in priority order until the money or assets run out. In most circumstances, any remaining debts will be written off. The only exception to this is if you acted as a guarantor or are a co-signatory of the debt.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're having to deal with a complicated estate, we’d advise seeking the </span><a href="http://solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advice of a solicitor or probate specialist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<b>Sorting out the debts of someone who has died</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step in paying off debts is working out what debts have been left. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll need to check if there is a guarantor for any of these debts. If there is, the guarantor remains responsible for any debt covered by a guarantee if it is not payable by the estate (due to insufficient money/assets).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Different forms of debt require different methods of payment. So we advise </span><a href="https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/family-and-care/death-and-bereavement/dealing-with-the-debts-of-someone-who-has-died"><span style="font-weight: 400;">checking out this article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a more in-depth look at the different forms of debt and how best to pay them off.</span>

<b>What do I do if I’m struggling to pay off debts after a death?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re struggling to pay off your partner's debts after they’ve passed away, or if the sudden drop in income makes it difficult to keep up with your own debt payments, it can be hard to know where to turn.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to know you don’t need to struggle alone with your debt worries. There are many ways to manage your debts and what will suit you best will depend on the specifics of your circumstances.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s always best to </span><a href="https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">talk things through with an experienced free debt adviser </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">before you make a decision about what to do.</span>
<h2>Apply for Probate</h2>
<h3><b>What is Probate</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When someone dies and leaves property, money and possessions (known as their ‘estate’) you need to sort out who gets what. To distribute the estate you need legal authority, which is granted by a document called a 'grant of representation'.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The person who distributes the estate will either be an Executor (if there is a Will) or an Administer (if there is no Will). Once they have applied for the ‘grant of representation’, the Executor will get a 'grant of probate' and the Administrator will get a 'grant of letters of administration’ - this means they are now legally able to sort out the Estate.</span>
<h3></h3>
<h3><b>Help with Probate</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of applying for the grant and the document you use to manage the estate is referred to as 'probate’.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For step by step help </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/applying-for-probate"><span style="font-weight: 400;">visit the Government website</span></a>

<h3><b> Useful things to note</b></h3>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there's only jointly-owned property and money which passes to a spouse or civil partner you will not need probate. You can get advice from HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) on whether probate is necessary.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Application fees for probate are £155 if you apply through a solicitor and £215 if you're taking the DIY option. Estates worth less than £5,000 pay no fee.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Probate is the same for everyone in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but if you live in Scotland it's called 'confirmation'.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It usually takes between four and eight weeks to get a grant of probate after you've submitted the application</span></li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h3><b>An overview of the Probate Process</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If your loved one had a will you’ll need to apply for a grant of probate.</span>

<strong>The probate process: how long does probate take, and who can do it?</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Obtaining a grant of probate allows you to access your loved one’s assets and distribute them in accordance with their will. The executor of the will should apply for probate within a few months of your loved one’s death, as it may be necessary to access and close certain accounts that your loved one held. The probate process can vary in length, but on average, administration takes 6-9 months.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t need it if:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person had no assets outside the UK, and</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All assets were jointly owned (eg. Mr &amp; Mrs Jones’s bank account), </span><b>or</b></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The value of the estate is less than £10,000 – but make sure you check with the financial providers!</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You are likely to need probate if any of these apply to you:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your loved one had any assets overseas – this includes property or financial accounts</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your loved one had financial assets valued at over £10,000 that were not jointly owned e.g stocks, shares, savings</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the value of your loved one’s estate (everything they owned) is more than £10,000 – this includes property, money and possessions. Each bank has its own threshold to determine whether you need probate to access your loved one’s account with them</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To find out the thresholds for probate, contact the account provider(s). If you do need to apply for grant of probate, follow the steps in our guide below:</span>

<h3><b>Estimating the value of the house</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You need an estimate of the estate’s value to find out if there’s Inheritance Tax to pay.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The estate will not have to pay tax as long as one of the following applies:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it all passes to the spouse or civil partner of the person who died</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it all passes to a charity or a community amateur sports club</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it has a value below the Inheritance Tax threshold of £325,000</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the person who died was widowed or is giving away their home to their children, </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/inheritance-tax"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the tax threshold can be higher</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're the Executor or Administrator, you'll need to sort out any inheritance tax (IHT). If inheritance tax is due, you need to pay some of it before your ‘grant of probate’ can be issued, then in most cases, you've six months to pay it in full. Once you have paid some of the inheritance tax, you are said to have 'obtained probate’. In Scotland, this is known as 'confirmation' and the process is different.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find an estimate of your inheritance tax using the Government's free online calculator: </span>

<h3><b>Useful Things to Note</b></h3>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inheritance tax is paid on the estate if it's worth more than £325,000 after debts are settled (and there aren't any other exemptions that need to be applied - see HMRC for more).</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anything above this is taxed at 40%, (which can be reduced to 36% if 10% or more of the post-IHT value of the estate was left to charity)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This normally needs to be paid within six months from the end of the month when the person died. You can defer tax and pay in instalments on some types of assets, including land, some shares and the value of any business owned (not the assets).If assets are being transferred to a surviving spouse or civil partner, no inheritance tax will normally be charged. The rules on this are complex, see HMRC for help. This Inheritance Tax guide also has useful info on how the system works.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most big banks have arrangements to send cash from the deceased's bank account directly to HMRC to cover this.</span></li>

<h2>What to do with Their Belongings</h2>
<h3><b>Sharing possessions with family</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You are likely to come across many items that have sentimental value rather than monetary value, and you can discuss who will keep which items with your family members. This process can be a lovely way to hear about each other’s memories with the person who has died, and you’ll often find that items have a different meaning for each person.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need help deciding how to share out items, everyone in the family can have a pack of stickers and can stick them onto the items they’d like to keep as they go round the house. You can then discuss any overlaps and come to a decision.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When sharing out items with monetary value, some families allocate an equal ‘allowance’ to each person and place a price or value on each item, which they then ‘bid’ on. This works best when family members get on well and can keep it lighthearted.</span>
<h3></h3>
<h3><b>Donating items to charity</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After sorting through your loved one’s belongings, you’ll probably have plenty of things you could donate to charity. Choosing a charity that meant something to your loved one can be a nice way to </span><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/remembering-a-loved-one/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">honour their memory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Or, you might want to support organisations that helped care for your family member in some way, such as a local hospice or Age UK.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before taking your donations to the charity shop, find out which items they will or won’t accept. For safety reasons, many charity shops won’t accept electrical goods and will only accept furniture with fire safety labels still attached (If you do have electrical goods, Cancer Research UK is one of the few charities that will take them, but they don’t accept white goods).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Charities say that they appreciate clothing, accessories, homeware, linen and books, as they sell particularly well. Some charities will come to collect larger items, such as wardrobes and beds.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another option is to sell items, then donate the money you raise to the charity as a cash donation (they can also claim gift aid if you’re a taxpayer).</span>
<h3></h3>
<h3><b>Tips to Selling Belongings</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may have items that are in a good, saleable condition that you decide to sell; this could be anything from large furniture, like wardrobes and dressers, to smaller items like clothing or crockery. eBay and local social media selling sites can be good places to list items for sale. For smaller, less valuable items, you might decide to hold a car boot sale.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have sorted through their possessions, you need to decide what to do with their house. You need to check whether they owned the house outright or if there is an outstanding mortgage to pay to the bank. After this, you might decide to keep their house, to either live in, rent out or sell. We’d recommend taking advice from a solicitor. before making a decision, particularly if family members disagree on the best option.</span>
<h2>Their digital accounts</h2>
<h3><b>Access their email address</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaining access to your loved one’s account when they pass can help you identify tasks that might otherwise remain unknown such as accounts to close or subscriptions to end. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to their email account will also allow you to reset passwords for accounts so that you can gain access and close them.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many email account providers only allow you to close a deceased user’s account; submit a request for funds from a deceased person’s account; or obtain data from their account. This means gaining access to an email account is usually prohibited by providers and the laws surrounding access after death are murky. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re happy to follow standard protocol, for gmail accounts </span><a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/troubleshooter/6357590?hl=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’ll need to fill in this form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; and for </span><a href="https://uk.help.yahoo.com/kb/options-yahoo-account-owner-passes-sln26120.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">yahoo accounts head here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our recommendation is to contact the provider directly and let them know your circumstances and why you need access to the account. </span>

<h3><b>Accessing cloud/online storage</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical possessions made it fairly easy to know who owns what when someone passes away. However, with so much of our lives now taking place online, more and more of our assets are moving online too.  And this causes quite a bit of complexity in terms of identifying who owns what (you or the company that sold the asset).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, if your loved one purchased a song through iTunes, what they purchased was the temporary rights to the song. In other words, they don’t actually own it and so it can’t be passed on to you or anyone else. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, stored photos, videos and documents, are owned by the deceased and therefore can be passed on. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of gaining access to your loved one’s cloud/online storage requires you to contact the storage provider, usually with at least the following documentation: </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full name of the deceased</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The email address of the deceased</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full name of the relative or legal representative</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Email of the relative or legal representative</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Address of the deceased</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Date of death</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A copy of a document appointing the requesting party as the personal representative or executor of the estate of the deceased; and</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A copy of the death certificate of the account holder</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Cancelling monthly on-demand subscriptions</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cancelling online subscriptions following the death of a loved one will avoid any unnecessary charges or fees. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have access to their email address, cancelling a subscription is as easy as resetting the relevant account password (the company will send a generic password to your loved one’s email address and you can use that to log in). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t have access to their email address, the quickest way to cancel a subscription is to search for the company’s customer support number and call them up. </span><a href="https://www.cpjfield.co.uk/planning-a-funeral/after-the-funeral/cancelling-leisure-entertainment-accounts-after-death"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article provides a helpful list of the most popular leisure and shopping accounts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Amazon, PayPal, Ebay, Spotify, Netflix etc.) and the relevant links and/or numbers that’ll get you access the accounts. </span>

		How To Face The New Year When You’re Grieving
		https://untanglegrief.com/how-to-face-the-new-year-when-youre-grieving/
		Fri, 24 Dec 2021 11:26:47 +0000
		team
		https://untanglegrief.com/?p=2436
		
		<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you lost someone you loved in 2021, our condolences. We at Untangle know how hard this is. Feelings, especially in that first year, can prove very mixed: Sad that they’re gone, lonely in your grief, angry at the world for carrying on and sometimes, relieved that they’re no longer suffering. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whilst grief isn’t linear and whilst these feelings don’t necessarily lessen, you will adjust and learn to live alongside them. </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Changing times</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Year can bring to grievers a sense of trepidation. For the first time, you won’t be able to say that you lost someone this year. Suddenly, you lost them ‘last year’ and you become acutely aware that they won’t ever know 2022. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s okay to lean into that feeling and to recognise that you have lost something significant within these last 12 months,” says Clinical Psychologist Dr Marianne Trent of </span><a href="https://www.goodthinkingpsychology.co.uk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good Thinking Psychological Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “It’s totally normal that it might feel hard to fathom a year that your loved one will never know.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may also worry that friends and family might not check in as often, and in the team’s experience, many of them won’t. People, especially those lucky enough not to have experienced close loss, won’t know how important that is. But some will keep checking in, and they will prove a Godsend. Take the matter into your own hands and ask people to check in. Your loved ones will want to do what’s right by you, so find a time to air these anxieties with them. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you can, open up to other people you know who have been through similar experiences to you,” says Behavioural Psychologist Jo Hemmings. “According to research by Recognised, 48% of us feel less alone when we hear people share the same struggles we face. But if you’re the first of your friends going through this, don’t be afraid to speak to them as well.”</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Don't suffer alone</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The same research showed that 47% of Brits said that they suffered in silence (with an issue of their feelings) in the last 18 months because they didn’t want to burden others but 41% believe that the pandemic has made them more able to empathise and put themselves in other people’s shoes. “So you might be surprised at how much they understand or can recognise how you’re feeling,” Hemmings says. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And don’t </span><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/the-myth-of-stages-of-grief/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concern yourself with ‘timelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ either. Grief doesn’t have an expiry date. “It’s okay to still be moved by your grief and not to be too concerned whether people think you should be ‘over it by now’ because it happened last year,” Dr Trent explains. Grief comes in waves, sometimes you will feel fine, and sometimes you won’t. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Complicated feelings</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Guilt can also be a common feeling at this time of year. “It’s really common that people report that they feel guilty about getting to carry on,” Dr Trent continues, but it’s okay to feel okay right now. “We don’t deserve to suffer and it is absolutely fine for you to turn your face towards the sun again and enjoy the warmth it has to offer.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can go further than that too. Why not use this time of year to take extra good care of yourself? It’s a lovely way to honour your loved one and what they would have wanted. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you’re making time for self care and exercise,” says Jo Hemmings. “Maybe go for a cycle, brisk walk or have a workout? Or go online and offer your empathy and support to others who may be grieving and alone.” The </span><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/news-feed/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Untangle Forum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/chats"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spaces are the perfect place to start. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Marking time mindfully</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And if you’re feeling ready to end a year in which you’ve known such pain and face the new year head on, </span><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/remembering-a-loved-one/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acknowledging this time in a mindful way</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can prove healing. “Some people find it helpful to mark the passing of someone they loved with something which will continue to grow, such as a plant or tree,” says Dr Trent. “It can give a mindful focus for loving and tending and allow us to assimilate the time since loss with growth.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, make 2022 the year when you learn to live with your loss. Finding the perfect therapist can take time, but therapy can help you to understand and process your feelings. Untangle can match you with the perfect grief therapist </span><a href="https://untangleonline.typeform.com/to/mU2OH38O"><span style="font-weight: 400;">using one quick questionnaire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you’re in crisis right now, get help straight away. Dr Trent says: “If you are concerned about your wellbeing, ability to function, the number of mounting problems and your risk level it’s really important that you reach out for support via your Doctor, mental health team or an accredited therapy service.”</span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Here for others</h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, if you’re here because you’re trying to help someone who is grieving, firstly kudos for signing up to Untangle. You’re already trying to educate yourself on grief and are working hard to make them feel a little less alone. But it can be a lot simpler than that. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s easy to get swept up in the business of our everyday lives but if you have friends of family members you know are going through a hard time, take a moment to check in with them,” Jo Hemmings says. “According to research by Recognised, what makes Brits feel the most valued and appreciated is the simple act of someone checking in to see if they are okay. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Small gestures of kindness or compassion, like sending a quick text or giving someone a call, can often have a more positive impact on our well-being, than grand or expensive gestures. It shows us that people are considering our feelings as well as understanding them, which in turn immediately boosts our levels of oxytocin and serotonin - hormones which can help us feel calmer and happier - while reducing our stress hormone, cortisol.“</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However you choose to see in the New Year, we hope the above advice helps you to realise that you’re not alone in facing a new chapter of your life. </span><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/sign-up/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Join our free community</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to speak to others in the same position and know you’re not alone on New Year’s Eve.</span>

<p class="has-text-align-center has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#fbe0c3;color:#003946">To meet others who share a similar experience of loss, including access to over 25+ support spaces, <a href="https://onelink.to/zka2sa">download the Untangle app</a>. <br>We’re all in this terrible club together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The late bell hooks knew that where there is grief, there is powerful, enduring love. “In its deepest sense,” she wrote, “grief is a burning of the heart, an intense heat that gives us solace and release.” Whether you have lost someone yourself or are comforting another who has lost a loved one, it can feel like there is nothing that can be said to make it better. But as exemplified by bell hooks, the greatest grief quotes provide comfort by sharing an experience of this pain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collected from the work of historic writers, poets, and songwriters, the following quotes incorporate a number of perspectives to guide through feelings of grief and loss. They stand apart from the rest— offering wisdom about living with their memory, absence, and the grieving process itself.</span></p>

<h3><b>Quotes about grief and memories:</b></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. “Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touches some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, you’re there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All day through.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">— Billie Holiday, “I’ll Be Seeing You”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. “So when you need her touch</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And loving gaze</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gone but not forgotten</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the perfect phrase</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smiling from a star</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That she makes glow</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trust she’s always there</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watching as you grow</span></p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. “Simply touching a difficult memory with some slight willingness to heal begins to soften the holding and tension around it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">― Stephen Levine</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. “A great soul serves everyone all the time. A great soul never dies. It brings us together again and again.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">— Maya Angelou</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">9. “You will lose someone you can’t live without, and your heart will be badly broken, and the bad news is that you never completely get over the loss of your beloved. But this is also the good news. They live forever in your broken heart that doesn’t seal back up. And you come through. It’s like having a broken leg that never heals perfectly—that still hurts when the weather gets cold, but you learn to dance with the limp.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">— Anne Lamott</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know what it would do</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leave me wishing still, for one more day with you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">— Diamond Rio</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">12. “Sometimes, only one person is missing, and the whole world seems depopulated.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">— Alphonse de Lamartine, Méditations Poétiques</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">13. "When someone you love dies, and you're not expecting it, you don't lose her all at once; you lose her in pieces over a long time - the way the mail stops coming, and her scent fades from the pillows and even from the clothes in her closet and drawers. Gradually, you accumulate the parts of her that are gone. Just when the day comes - when there's a particular missing part that overwhelms you with the feeling that she's gone, forever - there comes another day, and another specifically missing part."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">— John Irving</span></p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">15. "The melody that the loved one played upon the piano of your life will never be played quite that way again, but we must not close the keyboard and allow the instrument to gather dust. We must seek out other artists of the spirit, new friends who gradually will help us to find the road to life again, who will walk the road with us."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">— Joshua Loth Liebman</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">16. “Never. We never lose our loved ones. They accompany us; they don’t disappear from our lives. We are merely in different rooms.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">— Paulo Coelho</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">17. “I should know enough about loss to realize that you never really stop missing someone-you just learn to live around the huge gaping hole of their absence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">— Alyson Noel</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">18. “For as long as the world spins and the earth is green with new wood, she will lie in this box and not in my arms.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">― Lurlene McDaniel</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">19. “When I saw your strand of hair I knew that grief is love turned into an eternal missing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">― Rosamund Lupton</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">20. “Without you in my arms, I feel an emptiness in my soul. I find myself searching the crowds for your face—I know it’s an impossibility, but I cannot help myself.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Nicholas Sparks</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">21. “What they never tell you about grief is that missing someone is the simple part.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">― Gail Caldwell</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">22. “Absence is a house so vast that inside you will pass through its walls and hang pictures on the air.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">— Pablo Neruda</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><b>Quotes about grief:</b></h3>

<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">24. “Look closely and you will see almost everyone carrying bags of cement on their shoulders. That’s why it takes courage to get out of bed in the morning and climb into the day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">— Edward Hirsch</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">25. “No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear. I am not afraid, but the sensation is like being afraid. The same fluttering in the stomach, the same restlessness, the yawning. I keep on swallowing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At other times it feels like being mildly drunk, or concussed. There is a sort of invisible blanket between the world and me. I find it hard to take in what anyone says. Or perhaps, hard to want to take it in. It is so uninteresting. Yet I want the others to be about me. I dread the moments when the house is empty. If only they would talk to one another and not to me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">— Hillary Stanton Zunin</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">27. “And once the storm is over you won’t remember you how made it through, how you managed to survive. You won’t even be sure, in fact, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm you won’t be the same person who walked in. That’s what the storm’s all about.”</span></p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">31. "There is a sacredness in tears. They are not the mark of weakness, but of power. They speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues. They are the messengers of overwhelming grief, of deep contrition, and of unspeakable love." </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">— Washington Irving</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">32. “Grief is like the ocean; it comes on waves ebbing and flowing. Sometimes the water is calm, and sometimes it is overwhelming. All we can do is learn to swim.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">— Vicki Harrison</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">33. “And when great souls die, after a period peace blooms, slowly and always irregularly. Spaces fill with a kind of soothing electric vibration. Our senses, restored, never to be the same, whisper to us. They existed. They existed. We can be. Be and be better. For they existed.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">— Maya Angelou</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">34. “Deep grief sometimes is almost like a specific location, a coordinate on a map of time. When you are standing in that forest of sorrow, you cannot imagine that you could ever find your way to a better place. But if someone can assure you that they themselves have stood in that same place, and now have moved on, sometimes this will bring hope.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">— Elizabeth Gilbert</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">35. “Grief can be the garden of compassion. If you keep your heart open through everything, your pain can become your greatest ally in your life’s search for love and wisdom.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">— Rumi</span></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#fbe0c3;color:#003946">To meet others who share a similar experience of loss, as well as access to our parent loss support group, <a href="https://onelink.to/zka2sa">join the Untangle app</a>. <br>We’re all in this terrible club together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Losing both of your parents,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> no matter what age you are, can be painful and scary. You may find that your family structure has suddenly changed and the people you’ve depended on for years aren't there any more to support you. It can be exposing, vulnerable and lonely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve heard terms like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘adult orphan’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘double parental bereavement’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‘double parental loss</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ being used to describe your situation, you may be wondering what this all actually means. ‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adult orphan’ </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is not a term we usually like to use at Untangle, but we understand that you may have some questions around it. So we’ve put together a guide to help make things a little easier and less confusing. In this guide we’ll look into answering important questions like:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can an adult be an orphan?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> orphan syndrome in adults</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> look like?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does becoming an orphan in your 20s, 40s, 50s and beyond feel like?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our work at Untangle means that we’ve seen up close how there’s no universal way to experience grief. Going through something as defining and unique as losing both of your parents can be a very lonely thing to experience. You may have a partner, children or you may be surrounded by friends and family, but when both of your parents die, it’s very normal to feel a sudden and strong sense of loneliness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t forget, you’re not alone. In this guide we’ve added in a few ways to help you manage your grief and get through the hardest days, but if you’re looking to talk to people who are going through similar experiences, <a href="https://join.untanglegrief.com/">join our community here</a>.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can an adult be an orphan?</span></h3>
<p><b>Y</b><b>es. An adult can be an orphan.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you think of an orphan, you’ll probably be thinking of someone under the age of 18 who has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lost both of their parents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. An adult, with real-life responsibilities like paying bills or having a full-time job or even having kids of their own, may not be the first image that comes to mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Emily Dean’s article</span><a href="https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/real-life/adult-orphan-1/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‘Things you only know if you’re an adult orphan’ </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">she talks about how the word ‘orphan’  just feels strange when it’s used by an adult. As she says, “Orphans have tight, red 1970s perms and kindly wealthy benefactors. They don’t have mortgages and powerful anti-ageing creams”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the textbook definition of an orphan is a child who has</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lost both parents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, adults can be considered orphans too. The word orphan has expanded broadly over time, so it can be used to describe anyone who has lost their biological parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘adult orphan’</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is commonly used to describe someone who has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lost both parents in adulthood</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">orphan syndrome</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orphan syndrome </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a psychological condition that can come from losing one or both parents. It’s not always caused by something physical, like your mum or dad (or both parents) dying, it can also be caused by an emotional loss of parents that comes through neglect or abandonment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orphan syndrome</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is sometimes known as ‘abandoned child syndrome’ when it’s seen in children. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">orphan syndrome</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in adults look like?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orphan syndrome</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in adults is a type of anxiety. It can look different for everyone and it comes in many shapes and sizes. There’s no one-size-fits-all way to experience grief; grief can turn your world upside down, and it can impact our lives in very different ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few common signs of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">orphan syndrome</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in both adults and children:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fear of being abandoned</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anxiety or panic when a friend or family member leaves for a period of time</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fear of being alone</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low self-esteem</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People experiencing grief that’s caused by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">double parental loss</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sometimes talk about something called ‘grief brain’. ‘Grief brain’ is what happens to your brain when you’re overloaded with feelings like sadness, loneliness and grief. It can affect your memory and concentration and lead to sleeping difficulties, anxiety and even migraines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s normal to feel overwhelmed and lonely after losing both of your parents. If you’re looking for support to help you through it, or to connect with people experiencing something similar, you can <a href="https://onelink.to/zka2sa">join our wonderful and supportive community here</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">becoming an orphan in your 20s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">40s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">50s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and beyond feel like?</span></h3>
<p><b>It can make you question your identity</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experiencing the loss of one parent is incredibly painful no matter what age you are, but going through </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">double parental loss</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an adult can bring on entirely new feelings of grief. Some people say that it causes a sudden questioning of your identity and your own mortality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caron Kemp lost both of her parents by the time she was 36. In </span><a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/reports/a33623630/losing-parents/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an article written for Cosmopolitan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Caron describes the impact that losing both parents and becoming an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘adult orphan’ </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">had on her sense of identity. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I lost my identity as someone’s daughter, I lost the family and friends only connected to me through them, and I lost anything standing in the pecking order between me and my own demise”.</span></i></p>
<p><b>It can bring up old, buried feelings of grief</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Losing both parents as an adult</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can also trigger feelings of grief you thought were behind you, and this can sometimes be latent grief for the first parent you lost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a very human reaction to keep yourself busy after experiencing a significant loss, like the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> death of a parent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. People often find that there’s so much going on and plenty of welcome distractions at first. <a href="/our-advice-for-planning-a-funeral/">Organising the funeral</a>, notifying friends and family, sorting out their estate and will. The list goes on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But once the dust settles, you may find you have more time to think about what’s happened, and that’s when we often see the grief start to sink in. It’s at this point that we see </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the loss of a second parent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uncover feelings of grief for the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> loss of the first parent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These are often feelings that people may have thought they’d put behind them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re grieving the loss of one or both parents, you can chat to our team of experts for advice and grief support by <a href="https://onelink.to/zka2sa">joining our community here</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>It can make you feel lonely and that’s very normal</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our work at Untangle has shown us how people who have lost one parent often find support in others who have been through something similar. But people who have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lost both parents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can often feel very lonely and isolated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Double parental loss </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">changes your familial status, and this can be particularly isolating if you find yourself as an</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ‘adult orphan</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ early in your adult life. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/02/you-will-behave-weirdly-what-i-learned-from-becoming-an-orphan-at-25"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel Golby</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wrote for the Guardian of his experience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> becoming an orphaned adult in his 20s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, saying </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“instances of grief, I have found, are unique, two never coming in the same shape. There is no one single catch-all solution.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s often an assumption that once you've dealt with grief once, you'll know how it feels and understand how it works. You'll have a list of tools and strategies and a support system to rely on. But each time you experience grief can actually feel very different from the other experiences you have. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to cope with the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">loss of both parents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coping with the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">loss of both parents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an incredibly difficult thing to go through. There’s no magic fix to help get rid of the pain and sadness that can come from being </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an orphaned adult. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some people, the grief of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">losing both parents</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comes as a shock. For others, it’s a slow and overwhelming realisation that things have changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The loss of a second parent can mean the loss of the home you grew up in. It could mean the loss of rituals that have lasted a lifetime, the loss of habits and practises that have lasted for decades,” said Bella DePaulo, a social science researcher at the University of California at Santa Barbara who has written about the resulting loss when parents die.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve put together a few ways to help you cope with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">double parental loss</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - it won’t take away the grief, but it’ll hopefully make things a bit easier.</span></p>
<p><b>Make time for your grief - your grief matters</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try not to dismiss your feelings or minimise your loss by telling yourself that your parents ‘had a good run’ or ‘it was their time to go’. These are often things we tell ourselves (or others) to help make death seem like a natural part of life. And while it may be true, sometimes saying things like this can undermine our very real feelings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make time for your grief, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">whether you’ve lost your parents in your 20s or 60s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There’s a lot to take in and it’ll take some time for you to adapt.</span></p>
<p><b>Find ways to stay connected to your parents and to celebrate their lives</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve seen members of our community stay bonded to their parents through doing small things like supporting their parent’s favourite charity, making their favourite meal once a week, or visiting their favourite restaurant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take time to listen to the music they loved, put up photographs of your parents around your house, bake a cake to celebrate their birthday and don’t be afraid to talk to family and friends about what they were like. Don’t forget, your loved ones want to support you through this grief, and you won’t be burdening them by opening up.</span></p>
<p><b>Be kind to yourself</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grief can manifest itself in physical and emotional ways; taking time to connect with both your body and what’s going on in your mind, is important. Try to move every day - whether it’s a walk, yoga, a run or even dancing in your room with the curtains closed. Practise self-compassion and kindness and celebrate the small wins in life.</span></p>
<p><b>Find a community that understands what you’re going through</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how hard your friends and family try to support you, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">becoming an orphan in adulthood</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is something that’s incredibly hard to explain to people who haven’t experienced it themselves. Find a community of people who have gone through this too, so you can turn to them for support when you need it. Reach out to people you know from your friendship group or work who have recently </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lost a second parent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, meet them for coffee and talk to them about how you feel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also safe spaces on Instagram, like </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/orphan_ish/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orphan_ish</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/untanglegrief/">our own page</a>, which both aim to normalise conversations around grief and loss. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And of course, there’s our wonderful and supportive <a href="https://onelink.to/zka2sa">Untangle community where you can chat with people going through similar experiences and reach out for expert help. </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

		<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bereavement cards, also known as sympathy cards, can mark the death of a family member, friend or pet. A bereavement card is a nice way to show someone you’re thinking about them after a loss.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bereavement cards are typically sent immediately following a loss, but you could also send one to mark a poignant occasion. For example, you might wish to acknowledge an anniversary or send a special first Christmas card after bereavement. You could even make a note in your diary to remind you every year.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes a good bereavement card?</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A good bereavement card comes from the heart and is written with the recipient in mind. </span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our tips:</span></h2>
<b>Be authentic.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Speak from the heart to reflect your relationship with the person receiving the card and their loved one who has died.</span>

<b>Acknowledge their pain.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It’s ok to acknowledge the pain of loss and let the bereaved person express their pain. Don’t encourage them to ‘keep their chin up’ or ‘stay positive’.</span>

<b>Don’t compare your own loss.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In most instances, it’s unhelpful to focus on yourself by talking about your own loss when someone is recently bereaved. However, there might be an exception if it's highly relevant, for example, if you’ve both had a loss under the same unusual circumstances.</span>

<b>Be specific with offers for help.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Although you might mean it when you say, “Let me know if I can help”, it leaves the responsibility on the bereaved person to reach out. Instead, try offering something specific, for example, “I can get your groceries and leave them on the doorstep”.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What should you write in a bereavement card?</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be hard to know what to write in a bereavement card, and many people worry about saying the wrong thing. Remember that the person for whom you’re buying the card is likely to simply appreciate the kind gesture. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no right or wrong way to send a message of condolence, and nothing anyone can write in a card will take away the pain of loss. However, some thoughtful, kind words can go a long way in helping someone find comfort in their grief.</span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few examples of good sympathy messages you could include in your bereavement card.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A short, simple message to acknowledge their grief.</span></h3>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sorry for your loss.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sending love at this difficult time.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our sincere condolences for your loss.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sorry to hear about the passing of your loved one.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My heart goes out to you.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offering practical or emotional support can help a recently bereaved person feel less alone.</span></h3>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m here for you.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know nothing I can say will take away your pain, but I’m here if you need a shoulder to cry on.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’d love to contribute to the funeral arrangements; please let us know what needs organising.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need help with the children, we’d love to have them, to give you some space.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you feel up to visitors, I’d love to come round and help with anything you need, even if just to talk and cry together.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Religious messages</span></h3>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m so sorry for your loss; you will meet again in Heaven one day.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">My prayers are with you at this difficult time.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted”. Matthew 5:4.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And he said to him, “Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.” Luke 23:43.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For more tips and suggestions on observing religious and cultural norms around death and dying, see our article: </span><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/grieving-across-different-cultures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What to say to people grieving across different cultures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personalised message</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t be afraid to talk about special memories you have with the person who has died. It can be very comforting for the people left behind to hear stories about their loved one’s life.</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am saddened to hear the news of X’s passing. I remember the day we first met when he told one of his corny jokes, and I knew we’d be firm friends! He’ll be greatly missed.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please accept our condolences at X’s passing. She talked about you and the children all the time at band practice. Do you remember when she made the band learn your wedding song so we could play it at your anniversary party? She wanted that day to be so special. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might find a meaningful quote that would resonate with the recipient. See </span><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/the-35-greatest-grief-quotes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 35 Greatest Grief Quotes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for ideas.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where to find bereavement cards</span></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are plenty of great places to find bereavement cards in the UK. Before you start looking, think about the style of the card that might suit that person. Perhaps they have a strong faith and would get comfort from a religious card, or would appreciate you acknowledging the passing of their beloved pet with a dog bereavement card.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the high street</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people like to see and feel bereavement cards before making a choice. Many well established high street chains specialise in greetings cards, including </span><a href="https://www.hallmark.co.uk/l/sympathy-cards/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hallmark</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.clintonsretail.com/cards/other-greetings/sympathy-and-loss"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clinton Cards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.cardfactory.co.uk/cards/occasion-cards/sympathy-cards/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Card Factory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Many of these stores can be found in your local town or city and feature a range of bereavement cards at different prices.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supermarkets and convenience stores </span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most supermarkets and convenience stores carry a line of greetings cards, although the selection of bereavement cards may be limited in smaller shops.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online greetings cards suppliers</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Online greetings cards stores include </span><a href="https://www.moonpig.com/uk/personalised-cards/sympathy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moonpig</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.thortful.com/cards/sympathy"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thortful</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.funkypigeon.com/cards/sympathy-cards"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funky Pigeon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. There are a few notable benefits to choosing and buying a bereavement card online. </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many online greetings cards stores will print a short condolence message of your choice and post the card directly to the recipient.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online stores often have a more extensive range of bereavements cards than high street shops.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can personalise your card, perhaps with a treasured photograph or meaningful quote to make it extra special.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some online stores also sell condolence gifts to purchase alongside your bereavement card, for example, keepsakes, flowers or a book (see our </span><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/the-30-best-books-on-grief/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">30 Best Books on Grief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for ideas).</span></li>

		How long does grief last?
		https://untanglegrief.com/how-long-does-grief-last/
		Wed, 23 Feb 2022 11:49:25 +0000
		emma.harvey

		<span style="font-weight: 400;">‘How long does grief last?’ It’s a question we often hear in the early days of a bereavement, when the future feels uncertain and you’re not sure what to expect from the journey ahead. Here, we talk about the importance of not setting timelines as you go through your grief, and why everyone’s experience is unique.  </span>
<h2><b>So, how long does grief last?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is, it’s different for everyone. There is no timeline for grief and, unfortunately, it doesn’t have an expiry date. It simply takes as long as it takes. What’s important is that you give yourself time to experience loss in your own way, without setting expectations or timelines, or feeling frustrated that it’s taking longer than you hoped. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every loss is different, and how you process your grief is unique to you. That’s why, while some may start to feel better within weeks, others could find it takes months or years. Many of us at Untangle have come to realise that our grief will never fully go away, but that our day-to-day lives have become more manageable as time has gone on. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It reminds us of Lois Tonkin’s theory that grief stays with us, but our life grows around that loss. It’s always there and it’s always the same size, but slowly you rebuild your world around it. How that grief presents itself can change, too. While, in the early days, it might be a very physical experience, later on it might be more emotional, but without the brain fog or exhaustion you felt at first. Usually, these feelings come in waves that hit stronger on some days, and gentler on others. Roll with them, knowing that a calmer tide </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the horizon, even if it doesn’t feel like it right now. </span>
<h2><b>What are the seven stages of grief after death?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some believe we go through seven </span><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/the-stages-of-grief-myth/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stages of grief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after a loss. These are: </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shock and denial</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pain and guilt</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anger and bargaining</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depression, loneliness and reflection</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upward turn</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reconstruction</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acceptance and hope</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>How long does each stage of grief last?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea was first introduced as five stages of grief by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, before ‘shock and denial’ and ‘acceptance’ were later added on. But we’ll be honest: at Untangle, we see these stages as something of a myth. While you might experience all of the symptoms above, the idea of a ‘checklist’ or a ‘correct’ way to grieve ignores how unique the grieving process is. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if you do go through these stages, know that the timing is different for everyone. Some of them may be fleeting, some may come and go, and some you may never feel at all. While these stages have often been interpreted as being in a set order, Kübler-Ross made it clear in her writing that they are not linear.</span>
<h2><b>What does grief do to your body?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Grieving isn’t just an emotional process. It can be surprisingly physical too, leaving you exhausted, achy, restless and even with cold or flu-like symptoms. Your mind and body are run down and burnt out, and you might feel that way for weeks or even months. It’s one of many reasons why taking a break is needed in those early stages of a bereavement. </span>
<h3><b>How long does grief fatigue last?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We wish we could tell you that it’s ending soon, but like all stages of grief, it takes as long as it takes to get over grief fatigue. Not only is your mind in overdrive and your body coping with a trauma, but you might also be suffering from insomnia, which adds to the exhaustion. Our advice is always patience, but if you feel that grief fatigue is lasting too long for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (not for someone else), you can speak to a doctor about ways to improve your sleep or energy levels. They might be able to offer suggestions on establishing a new sleep pattern, or vitamins to take that will support your body during this difficult time. </span>
<h3><b>How long does grief brain fog last?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brain fog is an all too common (and often frustrating) symptom of grief, but try not to be hard on yourself if you find you’re more forgetful in the first weeks or months after a loved one dies. There’s a lot of new information for your brain to process, both in terms of the actual loss and shock, and in terms of any difficult ‘death admin’ you may have to do. Where possible, lean on the help of others for the admin side of things. (Reading our ‘</span><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/what-to-do-when-someone-dies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What to do when someone dies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ complete guide may help also.) The brain fog should start to clear with time, as you overcome the shock. </span>
<h2><b>How long does pet grief last?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Pets are family, so when they pass away, the loss is heartbreaking – whether it’s a dog, a cat or another beloved animal. You haven’t just lost a loved one, but often a sense of routine that was built around caring for your pet. And, to make it harder, not everyone will always understand this kind of grief if they’ve not been through it. </span>

<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-we-need-to-take-pet-loss-seriously/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientific American</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says that, after the loss of a pet, acute grief can last two months, with symptoms of grief persisting up to a full year (on average). But, again, we recommend you never put a timeline on your feelings. We at Untangle have experienced this kind of grief, and know how hard it is to adjust to life without your pet. This is your reminder to not bottle up your feelings, and to find people who understand what you’re going through. One day you’ll be able to reflect on all your pet’s funny, unique quirks with a smile. </span>
<h2><b>Does grief last forever?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It can – and that’s okay. Grief may stay with you forever, but it won’t always feel as hard or all-consuming as it does right now. In the future, you might find that it’s triggered by a birthday or an anniversary – or just an unexpected memory. But the days in between will start to feel normal again, and missing your loved one will be more manageable. Some things that can help you on this journey include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning about grief, so you can understand why you might be feeling what you’re feeling, and what to expect along the way. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding your support, whether it’s a </span><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/events/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bereavement group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a good friend or a family member. Opening up, and also hearing others’ stories, can help you process your grief.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listening to your needs and not pushing yourself to do things before you’re ready. You </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> say ‘no’ when you want to.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking to HR or a trusted manager at work. </span><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/bereavement-guides/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Returning to work after a bereavement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be difficult, so it’s important you get the support you need.</span>
<h2><b>A note on complicated grief</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Feelings of deep sadness and hopelessness are common when grieving. However, you may be dealing with complicated grief if you:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find your feelings don’t become more manageable over time and/or worsen.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on little else but your loved one’s death for a prolonged period of time. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feel persistently numb, detached, and that life has no meaning or purpose.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experience depression, self-blame and/or guilt.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isolate yourself from others for an extended time. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wish you had died with your loved one.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Complicated grief is an ongoing state of mourning that will often be debilitating, but there are ways to find happiness in your life again. It’s important that you speak to a loved one or a doctor, who will be able to help you access the support you need, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">whether that’s </span><a href="https://untangleonline.typeform.com/to/mU2OH38O"><span style="font-weight: 400;">individual therapy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or medicine. You don’t have to struggle alone. </span>

		How to get grief counselling and what to expect
		https://untanglegrief.com/grief-counselling-advice/
		Fri, 11 Mar 2022 15:31:59 +0000
		emma.harvey

		<span style="font-weight: 400;">After losing someone you love, it’s not unusual to feel lonely or like nobody else understands. All grief is relative, and how you process your grief is something that’s completely unique to you. However, for many of us, bottling up our emotions is a common ‘coping’ mechanism; one that often leads to even deeper feelings of loneliness and a sense of isolation. This is one of many reasons grief counselling is recommended after a bereavement, but we know that seeking help can feel a little bit scary at first. To help you take that step, we’ve rounded up what you need to know about grief counselling; from why it’s so useful to the different types that are available to you. We hope it helps. </span>
<h2><b>How do I know if I need grief counselling?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Technically, there is no wrong or right time to consider grief counselling, and you don’t have to fit a certain criteria in order to seek help. However, many counsellors will tell you to wait a few months until after your loss, so you have had some time to process all that has happened and how it has changed your life. It’s never too late to get started, even if the bereavement first took place years ago, and there are no ‘rules’ on how difficult you must be finding your grief. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Grief counselling isn’t only for those mourning the death of a friend, family member or pet, either; there are other types of loss it can help you process, such as a divorce, losing a job or an estrangement. The fact that you’re grieving is reason enough for you to look into grief counselling, and there are certain signs that help may be essential. Here’s what to be aware of:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you feel like the sadness of a bereavement is taking over your life, counselling is designed to help you manage and live alongside your grief. It’s not necessarily about ‘moving on’ (for many of us, that’s not possible), but it’s about making space in your life for joy to reenter. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re bottling up emotions and trying to cope on your own, please know you don’t have to. Sometimes, talking your feelings through with a stranger (and a professional) can be easier than talking to those closest to you.  </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re supporting others and putting your own feelings on the backburner, grief counselling means you have someone looking out for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We all need and deserve that level of support. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have symptoms of depression, seeking help becomes all the more important. A prolonged sense of hopelessness or feeling like you don’t want to be alive anymore is your sign that it’s time to reach out today. </span><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/contact/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us know</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if there is any way we can help you take that first step.  </span></li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>What type of therapy is used for grief?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many different types of bereavement counselling available, and some you may find are more useful than others, depending on how you are currently dealing with your grief. Below are four of the most common, but if you’re not sure where to start, you can also get advice through our </span><a href="https://untangleonline.typeform.com/to/mU2OH38O?typeform-source=untanglegrief.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">therapy booking service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>
<h3><b>1. Talking therapy</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is what many of us think of when we hear the words ‘grief counselling’. The clue is in the name with this type of therapy; it involves simply talking to your counsellor about how you’re feeling and what has led you to seeking their help. Sometimes, just speaking your truth can help you better process what has happened to you, and understand a way forward that makes the loss more bearable. This is often the ‘starting point’ for people looking into grief counselling, and some go on to explore other types of therapy (such as the ones you’ll see below).  </span>
<h3><b>2. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">CBT is actually a type of talking therapy, which is used to help you and your counsellor identify negative thought patterns so you can work to gradually change them. Studies show that it can have a big impact on the quality of your life, as it helps you reframe troubling thoughts, behaviours or habits and turn them into something that helps you. You may even find it changes the narrative surrounding your loss, and allows you to dwell less on the things that hurt you. </span>
<h3><b>3. Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy (EMDR)</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The trauma of a loss can impact you both physically and mentally, resulting in a fight, flight or freeze response that makes your grief feel too overwhelming to process. If this sounds familiar, and you find certain triggers put you back in your trauma (such as seeing someone who resembles the person who died or smelling their perfume), EMDR therapy could help you ‘unlock’ that trauma and work through it. This won’t take the memories away, but it will make them more manageable, and help you break cycles of self-blame or guilt. </span>
<h3><b>4. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">ACT works on your ability to accept what has happened and the events surrounding your loss, rather than running away from it or trying to avoid it altogether. This type of therapy is sometimes helpful if you’re dealing with prolonged or complicated grief, as it’s designed to help you come to terms with your emotions, and develop techniques to overcome times when it hurts the most.  </span>
<h2></h2>
<h2><b>What do you talk about in grief counselling?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter what type of grief counselling you choose, expect to talk about the loved one you have lost, what they mean to you, and how you have been coping with your bereavement. It’s important you feel comfortable speaking with your counsellor, so they will work to establish a relationship with you before discussing anything that might be upsetting. From there, the way the conversation progresses depends on both you and your counsellor. Remember, their aim is to help you, and you can pause at any time if you want to. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>How do I get grief counselling?</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are various ways you can go about seeking help to manage your grief. To get started, we recommend one of these simple routes:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://untangleonline.typeform.com/to/mU2OH38O?typeform-source=untanglegrief.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find help right here at Untangle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. After asking you a few questions about you and your needs, we will partner you with a trusted and vetted therapist.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact your GP, tell them about how you are feeling, and ask for a referral to a recommended grief counsellor.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/mental-health/find-a-psychological-therapies-service/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fill out the NHS form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to find grief counselling and psychological help in your local area.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And don’t forget, urgent help is always available with the </span><a href="https://www.samaritans.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samaritans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Do not suffer in silence; you can call 116 123 for free at any time, day or night. </span>

		7 ways to say goodbye to a home

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parting with a home is never easy, and it’s undoubtedly harder when you’re parting with a house that’s filled with memories and after a bereavement. Here’s the Untangle guide to making this process just that little bit easier.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Take your time.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you can afford to, don’t rush into selling. Making big decisions in the immediate aftermath of loss isn’t advised, because it’s tricky to think logically in a time of such upheaval. You may sell a property that you later decide you wanted to keep. Remember, selling doesn’t always have to be the only option - renting the property out can sometimes cover mortgage and/or maintenance costs. However, if selling the house is right for you, read on to make parting a little less painful.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Capture everything.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Take photos of every room, ideally both furnished and unfurnished. Consider hiring a photographer to take professional photos of both the interior and exterior.&nbsp; Many artists can be commissioned to paint houses from photographs, and a framed painting of the house you’re saying goodbye to can make a lovely keepsake.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Host an informal memorial service.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Invite close friends and family around to the house over a day or weekend to enjoy the property with you one more time. It can be a great way to make one more set of memories in the space, and share further memories of the deceased and their life there one more time.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Take something with you. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some find it comforting to take a little piece of the house with them. Provided you’re not going to damage the property, taking a little light pull or finial and installing it in your own home can be a wonderful way to honour that property and keep it close.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Leave something behind.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Even more people like to leave something behind. You could write something small in a cupboard or in a window frame, carve your family name into a brick or tree outside, or bury a time capsule in the garden.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Create a memory book. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you choose a scrapbook or a photobook, creating a physical space to memorialise the building is a lovely keepsake. Knowing you have a document within arm’s reach that reminds you of the home, and that you can show to future generations, can be a really comforting thing to own.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Know that your home is the people who are important to you.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ultimately, it’s important to remember that this home is simply a collection of bricks, tiles, wood and glass. The memories which you associate with it are really stored in your head, and the protection the building once afforded you, truly resides in the people you love and care about. Selling that building changes nothing - you take the memories and love with you wherever you go, forever. </span></p>

		How to prepare for a death: a practical checklist
		https://untanglegrief.com/end-of-life-planning-checklist/
		Mon, 09 May 2022 16:02:16 +0000
		emma.harvey
		https://untanglegrief.com/?p=3656
		
		<span style="font-weight: 400;">One day, we’re all going to die. It’s an unavoidable fact of life, and something that many of us would prefer not to think too hard about. However, the truth is that preparing for death can make things easier for both yourself and those who love you. By getting your affairs in order, you can save them from added stress, while also making sure your wishes are heard. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If this is something you are currently thinking about, firstly, we hope you’re doing okay. Our </span><a href="https://untangleonline.typeform.com/to/mU2OH38O?typeform-source=untanglegrief.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">therapy booking service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is always there if you are going through a difficult time and need someone to talk to. We want to try and make end of life planning that little bit simpler for you or your loved one, which is why we’ve created this ‘getting your affairs in order’ checklist of practical tasks. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of these steps you can take on your own, but don’t be afraid to ask for help if you need it. This may actually be wise, as it will mean someone knows exactly what preparations you’ve made. The list might look long and daunting, but many of these things you’ll already have lying around </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">somewhere</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s just a case of finding them, getting them together, and sharing them with the right people.  </span>
<h2><b>1. Write your last will and testament</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first practical thing many of us think about when preparing for a death is the will. This sets out what will happen to your estate and belongings when you die, who will carry out your wishes and, if you have children, who will look after them. You can write a simple will on your own or find templates on Google that you can fill in. Make sure, when you choose an executor, it is someone you trust to act fairly and do exactly as you ask. We then recommend contacting a solicitor to read over your will, provide any feedback, and ensure the final document is legally binding. This is something we at Untangle may be able to help you with, so do </span><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/contact/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reach out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you’re looking for the right solicitor for you.  </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>2. Communicate your funeral wishes</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you know there is a certain song you want played or ritual carried out at your funeral, tell the person or people who would be responsible for planning the day. Maybe you want everyone to wear a certain colour, or there’s a reading you’d like them to listen to. Whatever your funeral wishes are, write them down and pass them on to someone you trust. This isn’t just for your own peace of mind; it’s helpful for your loved ones too. They won’t have to guess or wonder (or argue over!) what you might have wanted when the time comes. Dying Matters and the National Association of Funeral Directors have created a </span><a href="https://digitallegacyassociation.org/funeral-wishes-leaflet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘My Funeral Wishes’ leaflet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which you can print out and fill in if you need some help with ideas.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>3. Document all of your passwords</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So much of our lives is stored on phones and computers these days, which means that, chances are, your loved ones will need access to your devices at some point. Note down all of your passwords – including any for online banking, bill paying, emails, etc. – or better yet, use a password managing service to store them all in one place. </span><a href="https://1password.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1Password</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> keeps them all together, and lets you share with friends and family in a few taps. It’s completely safe (with plenty of security measures in place), but makes it easy to give people the access they need. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>4. Share locations for important paperwork</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two of the most important documents you can share with your loved ones are your life insurance policy and your pension details – but these can often be overlooked while people focus on the will. So, make sure you gather them up and place them in one location in your home, then tell your loved ones where they can find all the paperwork they need. Other documents and financial details to add in are: </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debts you might owe, including mortgage statements, utility bills in your name, leases, educational loan statements and other unpaid bills.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An outline of all bank accounts and credit cards you own.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your birth certificate and (if you have one) marriage certificate.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Life insurance documents, including mortgage cover.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any paperwork related to your property, including mortgage agreements and property deeds or leases.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relevant statements from Jobs &amp; Benefits Offices (for benefits) and/or the Pension Service.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Existing valuations of expensive items, such as jewellery or artwork. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PAYE form P60 if you are employed or recent tax calculations and returns if you are self-employed.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organ donor card.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passport, driving licence and any relevant membership cards.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Place them all in a clearly labelled folder to make things even simpler for the person looking for them.</span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>5. Make a list of who needs to be told</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those closest to you will probably know who to contact after you’ve passed away, but if you have some old friends you think they might forget, make sure to write their names and numbers down. This can go in the same folder as your important documents – just make sure someone knows it’s there. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>6. Consider your social media accounts</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no denying that social media has become a big part of our lives, so you may want to have an end of life plan in place for your Instagram, Facebook and Twitter accounts. Perhaps you just want them removed entirely, or maybe you want someone to create a post for you. Whatever the case, this is another thing to share with those closest to you. In your Facebook settings, you can even choose a ‘legacy contact’ to look after your account after you pass away or request that your account is removed once someone confirms your death.  </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>7. Make sure your car isn’t parked on the road</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your car insurance policy becomes invalid as soon as you have passed away, so if your car is parked on a road, nobody will be legally able to move it. Start making sure it’s parked up properly so it can’t become a problem later on. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>8. Ensure the executor has enough money</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It will be up to the executor of your will to gather money from your estate and pay off any debts and home bills that come through. However, they can only get money out of the estate when the grant of probate has been issued, which means they may need some funds up front to cover essential costs. Try to come to an arrangement that will ensure they have enough money to pay off those bills, as even the most straightforward estates can take months to process. Alternatively, the executor may be able to get help from a solicitor, who can contact creditors on their behalf and advise on how and when payment will be made. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>9. Arrange a home for your pet(s)</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live with just your pet(s), you’ll want them to go to a loving home; somewhere you know they’ll be taken care of and given all the care and attention they deserve. Think carefully about who you would want to look after them after you have gone. Someone they already have a relationship with would be perfect, as they’re likely to settle in much quicker. You could also register for the </span><a href="https://www.rspca.org.uk/whatwedo/care/homeforlife/howitworks"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RSPCA’s Home for Life</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and they will arrange a home for your pet on your behalf. There’s paperwork involved here so, again, make sure your pet’s plan is kept with all your other documents. </span>

&nbsp;
<h2><b>10. Check if there’s anything you want to get rid of</b></h2>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As well as things you’ll want to gather, there might be things you want to get rid of, too. That slightly embarrassing teenage journal comes to mind! This is just a friendly reminder to go through your belongings and check there’s nothing that makes you cringe too hard. (But don’t worry too much; the people who love you won’t judge those old ‘Dear Diary’ entries.)</span>

		Funeral songs - what and how to choose?
		https://untanglegrief.com/funeral-songs/
		Thu, 09 Jun 2022 11:51:10 +0000

		It’s not uncommon for us to use songs like bookmarks for the landmarks of life. We hear a song at a wedding or a funeral and then the next time we hear it, it transports us back.

That’s why music is such an important <a href="/our-advice-for-planning-a-funeral/">consideration for a funeral</a>. Pick funeral songs that embody your loved one - you'll forever associate your choices with them.

<strong>Now, every guide under the sun lists the same songs again and again - and whilst that's because they are genuinely the most popular songs for funerals, we decided to put it to our <a href="/">bereavement support</a> community. The result? A combination of the most chosen funeral songs across the UK with those that have a beautiful member story behind them.</strong>
<h2>Things to consider when choosing a funeral song</h2>
Given the gravity of your funeral song choices, it’s easy to get stuck deciding between a thousand different artists and songs. In these instances, <strong>we recommend choosing those that most closely match the preferences of your loved one,</strong> rather than random songs you hear on the radio (or those that you / your family like).
<blockquote>“I really struggled to pick funeral songs. <strong>I realise, looking back, that I was trying to please my family, rather than choosing based on my dad.</strong> I wanted everyone to feel like they had a connection to dad via the songs, rather than just something he loved to listen to. <strong>My advice? Don’t think of how the songs will be perceived.</strong> Don't strive to appease. Pick based on the person you lost - <strong>choose something that embodies them.</strong>” Ryan, Untangle member</blockquote>
<h2>Songs and stories from our community</h2>
The thing about a grief community is that everyone can relate - every member has been 'there'.

<strong>Whilst almost any person can curate a list of songs, the following have real stories behind them:</strong>

<h2>Funeral songs for dad</h2>
For some, it’s an easy choice - perhaps there’s a song that encapsulated him; maybe he had said which song he had always wanted to go out to. For others, it’s not so easy - it certainly wasn’t for me. <strong>There wasn’t one song that typified my dad. I had to go searching for inspiration</strong>.

With that in mind, here’s a collection of songs that have proven themselves to be both touching and popular songs for dad:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Dance with My Father</strong> - Luther Vandross</li>
 	<li><strong>Tears in Heaven</strong> - Eric Clapton</li>
 	<li><strong>Old Man</strong> - Neil Young</li>
 	<li><strong>Go The Distance</strong> - Michael Bolton
<em>"He always said it made him feel like he could do anything. And ge deserved a series welcome at the pearly gates." Keisha</em></li>
 	<li><strong>Wake Me Up When September Ends</strong> - Green Day</li>
 	<li><strong>Comfortably Numb</strong> - Pink Floyd</li>
 	<li><strong>Life On Mars</strong> - David Bowie</li>
 	<li><strong>A Case Of You</strong> - Joni Mitchell</li>
 	<li><strong>My Father’s Eyes</strong> - Eric Clapton</li>
 	<li><strong>Sailing -</strong> Rod Stewart
<em>"Dad had it at his mum’s funeral and dad requested it at his. It utterly destroyed me." Clare</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Funeral songs for mum</h2>
Choosing a song to say goodbye; it’s one of the hardest things you’ll ever have to go through. But, before you even think of a song, sit back, think of your mum - what were her best qualities? What are some of your favourite memories together? Now, is there a song that encapsulates those times? If so, choose it. If not, see if any of the songs below capture her spirit. Even if they don’t, hopefully they give you a steer in the right direction.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Your Song</strong> - Elton John</li>
 	<li><strong>Angel</strong> - Sarah McLachlan</li>
 	<li><strong>Supermarket Flowers</strong> - Ed Sheeran</li>

<h2>Funeral songs for the older generation</h2>
The beauty of music lies in nostalgia - <strong>hearing a song that an older relative loved can evoke powerful images of them in their heyday, and there’s so much beauty in that.</strong> For me, the process of picking funeral songs for grandma was incredibly powerful experience - her spirit was in the room; it was palpable. That came through playing some of the records that she ALWAYS listened to. I have a picture of her from when she was in her late twenties - that's the person I always picture dancing to them.

<strong>Here are some of the most popular funeral songs for the older generation:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Wind Beneath My Wings</strong> - Bette Midler</li>
 	<li><strong>We'll Meet Again</strong> - Vera Lynn</li>
 	<li><strong>Time To Say Goodbye</strong> - Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman</li>
 	<li><strong>How Great Thou Art</strong> - Elvis Presley</li>
 	<li><strong>Valley of Tears</strong> - Buddy Holly</li>
 	<li><strong>I’ll Be Seeing You</strong> - Bing Crosby</li>
 	<li><strong>Make You Feel My Love</strong> - Bob Dylan</li>
 	<li><strong>Ave Maria</strong> - Franz Schubert</li>
 	<li><strong>Nimrod</strong> - Edward Elgar</li>
</ul>

<h2>Modern funeral songs</h2>
This is very much a fluid category, in that the top 40 of the time will equate to 'modern' - whatever that means. When we asked our community, there were plenty of classic songs, but they certainly didn't dominate. In fact, there was a perfect blend of 'modern' vs 'classic'.

<strong>A selection of popular modern funeral songs, as chosen by the Untangle community:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>All of Me</strong> - John Legend</li>
 	<li><strong>Just the Way You Are</strong> - Bruno Mars</li>
 	<li><strong>Shut up and Dance</strong> - Walk the Moon</li>
 	<li><strong>Visiting Hours</strong> - Ed Sheeran</li>

<h2>Uplifting funeral songs</h2>
Funerals are always going to be one of the toughest things you'll ever have to go through - there's no denying that, but they're also a celebration of life and the impact our lost one had on all of our lives.

<p>The Death Anniversary. It’s such a weird and confusing term. Anniversaries are, for the most part, a celebration of milestones. But when you juxtapose it with a terrible moment - scratch that, the worst moment - in our lives, it becomes oh-so confusing.</p>

<h2 id="personal">My own battle with death anniversaries</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I lost my loved one in 2017. Unsurprisingly, it ripped my world apart. <strong>For the first year, I went into survival mode - for me, that meant suppression.</strong> It seemed logical to ignore the things that made me feel bad, and this was unlike anything else. <strong>After all, if you stick your head in the sand for long enough, maybe one’s troubles will dissolve into sweet nothingness? Of course, it never quite works out that way.</strong> My <a href="/therapy/">bereavement counsellor</a> didn’t think so. And it certainly didn’t for me. Suppression has long been known to extend the lifespan of unwanted feelings.</p>

<p>So, as you might've guessed, <strong>I didn’t do anything on the first anniversary of his death</strong>. It took me until year 3 to begin celebrating his life on that ominous date, January 6th. <strong>Now, I kind of look forward to it - I treat it as celebrating his life up until that point.</strong> To remember the amazing times we shared and use it as an opportunity to thank him for the impact he had on my life. And I regret not doing it in the first year.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In short, when you <a href="/what-to-do-when-someone-dies/" data-type="post">lose someone</a>, the anniversary of that loss is scary, but it can be marked in a way that honours them. That’s not to say it's easy to do or that the grief goes away - there will forever be a ping of sadness resting on my shoulder. But it can be, with will, a day for reflection and gratitude. </p>

<h2 id="tips">Tips for coping on a death anniversary</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As Tom mentioned, sometimes, you just need to switch off from the world; to shut yourself away and get through the day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>We asked the community and Untangle team for some quick tips for coping on death anniversaries. Here’s what came up:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>If you’re going to be around people, let them know that the date is approaching:</strong> <em>“you may not want to bring it up - why would you? - but letting friends and family know means they can be there to support you - or, in my instance, let me be.”</em></li><li>There may be others who are also affected by the loss (family or close friends of your lost person). <em>"<strong>I’ve found doing something together incredibly powerful</strong>.</em> <em>I find that others bring up amazing memories that I had almost forgotten."</em></li><li><strong>Plan ahead: </strong><em>“When I haven’t planned anything, I withdraw. It’s an anniversary of a death after all, why wouldn’t I? Planning enables me / forces me to put myself into a more positive mindset. Looking back, that definitely helps.”</em></li><li><strong>Don’t put yourself under pressure to do anything:</strong> <em>"It’s a tough day; you don't have to treat it as a celebration of life. Not doing anything is doing something in itself."</em></li><li><strong>Share your story and how you’re feeling on a grief community</strong>: <em>"There’s comfort in talking to people you don’t know who understand the precise agony of loss." </em></li></ul>

<p class="has-text-align-center has-text-color has-background" style="background-color:#fbe0c3;color:#003946">If you want to share how you're feeling, ask questions to others who have lost or simply read their stories, head on over to the Untangle community via the <a href="https://onelink.to/zka2sa">Untangle Grief app</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Whilst the sad truth is that death and loss are universal experiences, responses to loss are not: </strong>they’re unique, individual and personal, characterised by the circumstances and meaning of that loss, not to mention the resources available to a person.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"left"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-left">Some will cry, feel distress, withdraw, others will become fixated on purpose or a task at hand - the list is endless and each reaction is normal. <strong>There is no right or wrong. Everyone grieves differently.</strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>This is why stages of grief theories can cause problems.</strong> Culture has made it seem that grief is linear and that there is an expectation to feel a certain way, but for anyone coping with grief, these ideas <em>can</em> be harmful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With this in mind, we spoke to Untangle members about their experience of loss and the grieving stages, as well <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/medicine/about/divisions-and-units/psychiatry-and-applied-psychology/people/elizabeth.paddock" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr Lizzie Paddock</a>, Psychologist and Assistant Professor in Forensic Psychology at the University of Nottingham.</p>

<h2 id="stages">The stages of grief: what are they?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The 5 stages of grief theory was developed in 1969 by psychiatrist, <a href="https://www.ekrfoundation.org/elisabeth-kubler-ross/">Dr Kübler-Ross</a>, as a way of describing the emotional process experienced by those facing their own death.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The theory quickly gained traction and embedded itself into the public psyche as <em>the</em> model for dealing with bereavement and, in turn, became synonymous with the grieving process.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px"><strong>Answer:</strong><br>"Stages theories of grief are present throughout popular culture. However, evidence has shown that the grieving process is ‘neither a linear nor a fixed progression of stages’.<strong> The truth is, people may never experience some of these stages. Everyone’s grief is unique to them. And most people will not experience them in that order</strong> – instead, jumping back and forth between stages. Some researchers prefer to talk about the ‘components’ of grief.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px"><strong>The most important way to help yourself while grieving is to take care of yourself and your needs</strong> - being aware of how you are feeling. <br><br><strong>For many of us, talking about loss is an incredibly painful and difficult thing.</strong> It takes strength and courage to describe how you are feeling after a bereavement, and all too often, we avoid the conversation because we can’t find the right words. Do you feel this may be contributing to why you are not wanting to be around others?</p>

<h3>How can Tonkins model of grief help?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This frame of thinking means you can both be growing and grieving at the same time. <strong>Whilst there may always be a pang of sadness resting on your shoulder, you can make progress.</strong> Grief doesn’t go away, nor should you expect it to, but you can grow around it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many of our members have explained that they prefer this way of thinking as it steers away from grief having an endpoint, and instead explains grief as something that forms part of our identity, ever-present throughout the good and bad moments in our lives.</p>

<p><strong>This is something that David Kessler, co-author of <em>On Grief &amp; Grieving, also said, “</em></strong><em>the stages have evolved since their introduction and have been very misunderstood... <strong>They were never meant to help tuck messy emotions into neat packages.</strong> They are responses to loss that many people have, but <strong>there is no typical loss.</strong>”</em><strong><em> </em></strong><a href="https://grief.com/the-five-stages-of-grief/"><strong><em>Source</em></strong></a></p>

<h2 id="tips">How to care for yourself when grieving</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>The basics</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Listen to your body</strong>:<ul><li>If you need to rest or sleep, then do. Trauma is hard for the body to process and is tiring.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Look after yourself</strong>: <ul><li>Try to eat healthy food and get outside in nature. It won’t take the pain away but looking after your basic health will ensure you don’t make things worse for yourself.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Avoid numbing substances:</strong> <ul><li>Whilst it might feel like these take the pain away, they don’t. Instead, they delay those feelings from surfacing and extend the amount of time you spend in the ‘acute grief’ phase.</li></ul></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Your behaviour</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Accept change</strong>:<ul><li>You might notice your sleeping patterns or eating patterns change in the wake of a loss. These will return to normal so don’t fret. Do what</li></ul></li><li><strong>You’re exactly where you need to be</strong>:<ul><li>Don’t feel any pressure to be or act in a certain way. Some people like to keep busy and go out lots, others stay in bed and watch TV. Do what feels right for you.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Feel your feelings</strong>:<ul><li>If you need to cry, cry. If you want to laugh, laugh. Grief is not all sadness - sometimes it’s guilt, anger, joy and even relief. Try to embrace and lean into your feelings, rather than avoiding or pushing them down.</li></ul></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Your friends</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Ask for and accept help</strong>:<ul><li>If people offer to drop food round or take the kids for a few hours, take them up on it. Remember, you would do the same for them.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Try to be understanding</strong>:<ul><li>Some of your closest friends may avoid you in your grief, whilst others will surprise you with their kindness. Try not to be too angry with those who avoid you - their silence is usually because of their own discomfort around grief and death, not because they don’t love or care about you.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Be honest</strong>:<ul><li>You may feel some pressure to return to ‘normal’ because you worry your feelings may make others uncomfortable, but that will only make you feel more isolated. Open up and talk about your grief, even if it’s years from the loss. True friends will want to be there for you.</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>While medicines can help with pain relief and insomnia (and are worth talking to your doctor about), <strong>it’s also important to keep nurturing your body with food, exercise and routine.</strong> We’re creatures of habit, after all. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This can be easier said than done – all sense of schedule can go out of the window when after loss – but try reintroducing a routine with small steps. <strong>Take it day by day.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You could begin by deciding that, for a whole week, you’re going to get out in nature for a 20-minute walk each day. Exercise not only boosts serotonin, but exposure to daylight can also regulate your body clock, so you may sleep better at night.</p>

<h3><strong>Confusion</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly, everything feels so confusing. <strong>Even if you’re usually good at understanding documents, the sheer amount of ‘grief admin’ you have to go through can leave you completely overwhelmed.</strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Companies don’t always make this easy either (see <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/what-to-do-when-someone-dies/">what to do when someone dies</a>), which is why seeking support can be an important first step when it feels like your brain is more scattered than usual.</p>

<h3><strong>Lack of concentration</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Don’t be hard on yourself if you’re finding it difficult to pay attention to… well, anything.</strong> It’s a natural response to grief, and your mind has a lot to process right now.</p>

<h3><strong>Forgetfulness</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just as you might be finding it hard to concentrate, <strong>you may catch yourself forgetting things more often too.</strong> Again, this is because your brain is overwhelmed with the many thoughts and emotions you’re coping with.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3 class="has-text-align-center"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to deal with the cognitive symptoms of grief</span></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>The cognitive symptoms of grief can have the biggest effect on your work, so don’t be afraid to have some honest conversations with your employers and colleagues if you’re struggling.</strong> Take a look at our <a href="/bereavement-guides/">Bereavement &amp; Work guides</a> for more advice on this, including <a href="/returning-to-work-after-a-bereavement/">returning to work after a loss</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These cognitive symptoms can also be frustrating when you’ve got lots of ‘grief admin’ to tackle, so take a look at our guide on <a href="/what-to-do-when-someone-dies/">what to do when someone dies</a> for step-by-step advice. Think of it like a checklist that you can tick off as and when you feel ready. Take it at your own pace, and don’t hesitate to ask for help along the way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This frame of thinking means you can both be growing and grieving at the same time. <strong>Whilst there may always be a ping of sadness resting on your shoulder, you can make progress.</strong> Grief doesn’t go away, nor should you expect it to, but you can grow around it.</p>

		<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Unless you’ve experienced grief, it can be hard to know what to say when someone dies.</strong> In fact, even if you’re grieving yourself, words of comfort don’t always come easily. Ultimately, it’s a sensitive and challenging time, and the pressure to say ‘just the right thing’ can be overwhelming. So here’s our guide on what to say when someone dies. We hope it helps…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>First things first: it’s better to say <em>something</em> than say nothing at all, so don’t go silent on someone coping with grief.</strong> Radio silence can often be more hurtful than saying the ‘wrong’ words. You’re not always going to get it exactly right, but checking in just after a loss, and in the time that follows, can help your friend or family member feel a little less alone.</p>

<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px"><strong>“I’m so sorry for your loss/I’m so sad to hear about your loss.”</strong> - This is a simple yet meaningful way to start sympathy messages or conversations with someone who’s grieving.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px"><strong>“Can I do anything to help?”</strong> - The person who has recently lost will be struggling right now, so help from friends and family is more important than ever. If you can, make specific offers, such as “I’m going to the shops, can I get you anything?” or “would you like me to look after the kids today?”</p>

<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px"><strong>“I remember when…”</strong> - If you know them, talk about the person who has died. Share a favourite memory of them with their loved ones. It could be a funny joke they once told you or a time they helped you when you needed it most.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"color":{"text":"#003946"},"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px"><strong>“I’m thinking of you.”</strong> - Like “I’m sorry for your loss”, this is a simple line you can include in a text message, as it lets your friend or family member know you’re there for them when they need you.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px"><strong>“How are you?”</strong> - You already know the answer to this one – of course, they’re feeling terrible. However, by asking them, you’re creating an opportunity for them to open up.&nbsp;<br>Sending a card?

<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px"><strong>Show up for them.</strong> Remember wedding and death anniversaries, birthdays and other dates of note (such as Mother’s Day or Father’s Day). It will mean so much to them. You could reach out with a card and flowers, or just a simple message on the day. Or <strong>how about offering to take them somewhere to commemorate their loved one(s)?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px">It’s not just special dates that matter, either. <strong>It’s easy to feel apprehensive about mentioning someone who has died - after all, are you reminding people that they’re gone? The answer to this is no</strong>: they don’t need reminding; their loved one is always on their mind. By giving them the space to talk about them, you can help them to process grief.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px"><strong>“How are you?”</strong> - This one is so important both straight after a loss as well as in the time that follows. Those who are grieving don’t always feel comfortable bringing up their sadness, so invite them to express their feelings as time goes on. Then, when they answer, really listen to what they have to say. <strong>Don’t offer solutions</strong> (unless they ask you to); instead, acknowledge their emotions and the fact that it’s hard for them.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"color":{"text":"#003946"},"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px"><strong>“I just wanted to let you know that I’m thinking of you on their birthday/your anniversary/this Mother’s or Father’s Day.”</strong> - This message can apply to any important date, including a <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/death-anniversary/">death anniversary</a>. You may want to send a card at this time. Remain consistent with this too; don’t simply mark the many ‘firsts’, but reach out each year so they know their loved one isn’t forgotten.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px"><strong>“I just saw X and it made me think of the time Y…”</strong> - A message like this, any time, can mean so much to someone who is grieving. <strong>If you see a reminder of their loved one, let them know.</strong> Stories, memories and jokes are treasures to them.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"color":{"text":"#003946"},"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px"><strong>“At least…” </strong>- There is no ‘at least’ when someone is grieving. Their person is gone and it’s heartbreaking, so no ‘silver linings’ are going to suddenly make that feel okay.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"color":{"text":"#003946"},"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px"><strong>“I know how you feel.” </strong>- Even if you’ve experienced loss, don’t try to compare your grief with someone else’s. Every experience is unique, and comparing situations can make them feel somewhat trivial.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"color":{"text":"#003946"},"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px"><strong>“Don’t be sad.”</strong> - Or anything similar. Even if years have passed since the loss, telling someone that they shouldn’t be sad doesn’t achieve anything - it only makes them feel shamed or misunderstood. You might find that they talk to you less about their grief because they’re worried about being judged.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px"><strong>“Everything happens for a reason.”</strong> - If you’re wondering what to say when someone dies unexpectedly, avoid this line. In fact, avoid it regardless. It can be hurtful to hear, as it implies the death of a loved one was ‘meant to happen’.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"color":{"text":"#003946"},"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px"><strong>“I don’t know how you’re doing this.”</strong> - Some say this can make their grief feel bigger and unmanageable. It can also make them feel isolated, unable to vocalise their true feelings, due to both perception and a knowing that others are unable to empathise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"color":{"text":"#003946"},"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px"><strong>“Time’s a good healer.”</strong> - this is predicated on grief getting easier over time. It also adds an element of pressure to feel okay with the passing of time. This is wrong. Every relationship is different; every loss is unique. Grief doesn’t just get easier because another year has passed. For more info on this, check out our stages of grief article.</p>

<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px"><strong>“They’re in a better place now.”</strong> - While this may comfort some, depending on their religious beliefs, many say this is one of the hardest things to hear. <a href="/grieving-different-religions/">Grieving is different across cultures</a>, so be sure to know people’s beliefs before you make a statement like this. In other words, the use of this is not advised.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Everyone’s experience of grief is unique</strong>, so while these tips are meant to help you comfort your loved one, you may find the support they need looks different to the words on this page. That’s okay – <strong>keep the lines of communication open and accept that, sometimes, you might just say the wrong thing.</strong> As long as your intentions are good and you really listen to your loved one, you can help them through their most difficult times.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, if you’re really unsure, keep your words simple, <strong>don’t try to hurry them through the <a href="/stages-of-grief/" data-type="post">stages of grief</a></strong>, and don’t try to fix things. Showing up and letting them know you care is the most important thing of all.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p><strong>Lastly, do recommend a grief community - we have dedicated support spaces that aim to connect people over shared experiences of loss. </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>By Annabel James, founder of <a href="https://www.agespace.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.agespace.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Age Space</a></em>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The weekend after Mum’s funeral my 83-year-old Dad and I went out and bought new saucepans. Not what Dad would have had on his to-do list, but we didn’t really know what to do with ourselves, how to fill the time, and it would have been an outing Mum would have enjoyed.&nbsp; The start of some strange times, and the end of some strange times too. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Married for 60 years, their last decade together saw Mum’s health decline following a stroke.&nbsp; During that time Dad moved seamlessly from husband to that of super hero (my words not his) - <strong>general factotum</strong> with multiple roles including <strong>full-time carer</strong>. Also, <strong>personal assistant</strong> making appointments, sorting medication, doing paperwork; <strong>chief entertainment officer</strong> in charge of daily laughter, often after some medical mishap; <strong>head of logistics</strong> organising outings to friends, the hairdresser or just an afternoon drive on quiet days, usually with an ice-cream stop; <strong>quartermaster</strong> doing the shopping, paying the bills and running the hoover round;&nbsp; as <strong>constant companion</strong> to help with the fiddly business of socks and shoes, and <strong>transport manager</strong> helping her on and off the stairlift. He embraced them all with gusto and 100% enthusiasm for the task, whatever it was.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Mum died his grief was not only for the loss of his beloved wife, but for the loss of all those roles his life had become. &nbsp;Initially the routine was perhaps quite similar as he threw himself into the administration and paperwork of death of which - thank goodness - there is a mountain. Her <a href="/our-advice-for-planning-a-funeral/">funeral</a> was a labour of love with no detail left to chance.&nbsp; He spent weeks writing letters to everyone who called or wrote or delivered meals and flowers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over weeks and months, Dad sorted through Mum’s <a href="/belongings-after-a-death/">clothes and possessions</a>. He called her friends and family regularly, picking up where she had left off.&nbsp; The house adaptations and mobility aids were eventually returned from whence they came.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He started lunches with a fellow widower in the village. He went to a bereavement coffee morning at the local hospice which much to his surprise he found a great comfort.&nbsp; He visited Mum’s grave and came to enjoy spending time choosing flowers for her. &nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:media-text {"mediaId":4678,"mediaLink":"https://untanglegrief.com/?attachment_id=4678","mediaType":"image","mediaWidth":47,"imageFill":false} -->
<div class="wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:47% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img src="https://untanglegrief.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Annabel-James-agespace-with-dad.webp" alt="Annabel James, founder of Agespace, with her dad" class="wp-image-4678 size-full"/></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content"><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Slowly, life took on a new shape. He resumed old hobbies and adopted new projects that he’d not had time to do while he was juggling all those roles. He went on holiday and visited friends and family. His role of chief mourner slowly morphed into that of widower, and whilst it wasn’t overly merry, life did perk up.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div></div>
<!-- /wp:media-text -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If he was to give any advice or words of wisdom about life after caring for a spouse, partner, relative or friend, I think he would say three things: firstly, that time really became his enemy.&nbsp; Having had a decade of too little of it, after Mum died there was just far too much of it – so retaining a little bit more time for himself while she was alive may have been a good thing.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Secondly, he’d say that grief is a labour of love and a testament to the person who has died and your relationship with them.&nbsp; As such, the process of death, the funeral, the sorting, the memories, are memorials to that person.&nbsp; Embrace the rituals of death and grief for the person you loved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thirdly he’d say that shopping for saucepans probably won’t help with anything except the cooking, but whatever gets you through the day.</p>

<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px">A wake is a gathering that can take place before or after a <a href="/our-advice-for-planning-a-funeral/">funeral</a>. At a traditional wake, you would visit the body of the person who has died before the funeral service begins. However, <strong>it’s now common for a wake to be more of a reception after the funeral</strong>; a chance to talk with loved ones, share memories, and support one another. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"},"color":{"text":"#003946"}}} -->
<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px">No, you don’t have to host a wake. Like the funeral itself, it’s completely optional, but some prefer to organise one in order to get friends and family together before or after the funeral service. That said, if you don’t feel you want to, that’s completely fine as well. If you’re just unsure, weigh up the pros and cons, and don’t be pressured into doing anything you’re uncomfortable with.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"},"color":{"text":"#003946"}}} -->
<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px">The cost of a wake will vary depending on the venue you choose, the food and drink you serve, the decor you put up, and the number of people you decide to invite. <strong>To give you an idea, that the average ‘send-off cost’ in the UK in 2021 was £2,484</strong>. This includes the wake/memorial service and other ‘non-essential’ add-ons, such as catering and flowers.</p>

<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px"><strong>First of all, ask yourself, do you want the wake to be public or private? </strong>If you prefer, you can keep it small and intimate by only asking your closest family and friends to attend a get-together in your home or at a restaurant. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"color":{"text":"#003946"},"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px">You can also make it a bigger event by inviting everyone who attends the funeral, or perhaps keep the funeral small and ask people to come to the wake instead.

<ul class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px"><li><strong>The funeral home</strong>: a convenient choice that means you won’t have to make extra travel arrangements. This is especially appropriate if there will be a viewing at the wake.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>A house</strong>: your own, a relative’s, a friend’s, or the home of the person who has passed away.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>A pub, hotel or restaurant</strong>: ideal for a wake reception that takes place after the funeral. Some of these venues will allow you to hire out a room for privacy.</li><li><strong>A town hall, sports centre or community centre:</strong> these spaces are often available for last-minute bookings, and they’re ideal for a larger post-funeral wake.</li></ul>

If it’s a large group, we recommend providing details with an invitation, via email, or using Facebook Events.

<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px">However, if you’re hosting a small, intimate gathering, a quick, informal text message or phone call will do. <strong>Loved ones can also help you spread the word if you’re finding it difficult to speak to people.</strong></p>

Turns out, the doctors had been ignoring her symptoms for a couple of years because she didn’t have the typical risk factors for someone with cancer. She wasn’t overweight, didn’t smoke or drink, and this particular form of cancer doesn’t run in the family - so they weren’t looking for it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I remember her sitting down to tell us one day in February after school. “I’ve got cancer” she told us, “but don’t worry. I’m going to have treatment and surgery and everything will be fine”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I believed her. I didn’t know any differently and had never had any experiences with cancer before. I wasn’t prepared for what happened over the coming weeks and months.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mum started chemo and swiftly started to lose her hair, and as the weight fell off of her it became obvious that this was really serious. We didn’t know just how serious until just three months later our Dad sat us down to tell us “Mum won’t make it through the week”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was the first time I realised I was going to have to face life without my Mum. That I would have to go through all my teenage milestones - like having my first boyfriend, doing my A levels and applying to University - without her by my side.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She died just three days later, at home with her four children and surrounded by family.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default has-background has-medium-font-size" style="background-color:#cbe9da"><p>This was the first time I realised I was going to have to face life without my Mum. That I would have to go through all my teenage milestones - like having my first boyfriend, doing my A levels and applying to University - without her by my side.</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There's never a good time to lose your Mum, let alone when you’re a teenager going through your GCSE exams. I was pulled out of my Maths exam to be at home with Mum when she died, and I went back into school the next day to take another exam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the eldest of four children, with my younger sister being just 9 years old at the time, I ended up taking on a lot of adult responsibility very early on. Not only was I having to contend with the loss of my main attachment figure, I also had to focus on my education and taking the next steps to get through exams and into Sixth Form to do my A levels whilst also picking up a lot of slack at home while my Dad was struggling with his own grief. I’d be responsible for cooking, cleaning and looking after my siblings. There wasn’t a lot of room for my grief.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So I struggled through those late teenage milestones, barely scraping through my A Levels (with multiple threats of being kicked out of Sixth Form) and I made it into University to study Business Administration.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn’t really want to be at University, but I didn’t know what else to do. I felt completely lost and was still reeling from the trauma of losing my Mum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hadn’t realised until recently just how badly my world had spun off course at age 15. The future that I assumed was planned out for me, one that I’d dreamed about and was excited for, was now just a faint image in the distance. I wasn’t sure of anything anymore except that I wanted my Mum so desperately and I was sorely missing that safe, secure relationship that I didn’t have with anyone else.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having not had the space to grieve properly I found myself struggling with bad anxiety and depression all through my late teens and early twenties. At about age 23, it got to a point where it was so bad I had no other option but to get some support.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I reached out to a local counselling organisation to speak with someone about the challenges I’d been facing. It was the first time I’d had an open and non judgemental space to talk about everything that had happened over the last eight years. For the first time I was able to create the smallest window of space to air those really difficult feelings I’d kept bottled up inside. The ones I’d kept under lock and key for fear that if they came out they’d overwhelm me and I’d not be able to recover, like I’d never make it out from under the weight of them.&nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over time I started to feel like I could breathe again, like my lungs had just a bit more space to expand. I knew I was ready to find some inspiration to ‘start’ my life, but I didn’t know where to begin. I looked at people in my circle to see what they were doing with their lives and if there was anything that might spark some creative joy within me.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the time, my cousin was training to be a Play Therapist. I’d never heard of Play Therapy before but it sounded intriguing. She explained to me that it’s like counselling for children, but rather than using words to describe how they’re feeling or what they’ve been through they use toys and play. “Play is the natural language of children”, she told me.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In that moment I realised that something major had been lacking for me and my younger siblings when we were dealing with the trauma and grief of losing our Mum. We hadn’t had anyone we could talk to, or anywhere we could go to blow off steam and be children, with someone who understood how we might be feeling. All of the adults in our lives were also grieving and it made it hard for them to really give us what we needed at the time. No one at school was well equipped enough to support us either - we really were left alone in our separate grief processes.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As soon as my cousin explained Play Therapy to me, I knew I’d found something special - something inspiring. I wanted to provide Play Therapy to children and young people who’d faced trauma so they didn’t have to go through the same isolating and frightening experiences that I had. I set my mind to providing a service to local children through their schools, and started raising money.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the next decade I worked hard to build up a Play Therapy charity in Oxfordshire, one that would go on to win awards and support hundreds of children and families. <a href="http://www.clear-sky.org.uk">Clear Sky Children’s Charity</a> was born from my desire to make sure other children and young people didn’t feel so alone when they were facing really difficult things in life. I went on to do a Masters in Play Therapy and learn about ways that parents play a crucial role in children’s mental health, and how strong relationships (with remaining parents / carers) can provide protection for the developing minds of children and young people.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From my Masters research I devised a 6 step programme for parents and carers, called <a href="http://www.treasuretime.co.uk">Treasure Time</a>, to develop the strong foundations of good mental health, with strong communication and secure attachment between their children and themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn’t realise it at the time, but all of the work I was doing in the charity and with Treasure Time was part of me processing my loss. I found I could fill in missing pieces of my puzzle by learning about the way children experience and process trauma. I understood why I’d struggled so much with the loss of my Mum and that I really lacked age appropriate support when I needed it the most.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I realise now that seeing a child in pain, especially your own child, can be extremely triggering for parents. If you’re also grieving it might feel like an impossible situation to overcome. My best advice for parents is that your child really needs you to bring them in closer to you during this time. It’s easy for families to fracture after the loss of a parent in particular. Everyone has their own grief journey and you might not be on the same path at the same time. Everyone’s experience is valid.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where you can, normalise grieving. Normalise having conversations about the person you’ve lost. Acknowledge there will be days when you cry, and days that you laugh and everything in between. But you need to do parts of the journey together. It’s easy for children to feel isolated and scared when they’ve lost someone close to them, and this can make them vulnerable. To best protect your children and to preserve their mental health you need to make sure the relationship you have with them is strong and secure so that they know they can turn to you and count on you when they need your help.</p>

<p><strong>The weeks, months and years after a loss can take us through so many challenging moments.</strong> <a href="https://untanglegrief.com/our-advice-for-planning-a-funeral/">Planning the funeral</a>, <a href="http://untanglegrief.com/funeral-wake/">arranging the wake</a>, <a href="/calculating-the-value-of-the-estate-probate/">managing the estate</a> – and, of course, grieving in the midst of it all. If your loved one has been cremated, the question of scattering ashes is yet another hard decision. Should you do it, and if so, where? When? How? With whom? The answers aren’t always straightforward.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>It’s down to the executor of the will to ensure the person who has died has been laid to rest.</strong> If that’s not you, you’ll need their consent before you scatter the ashes. <strong>And, in the event that there is no will, it’s the next of kin’s responsibility.</strong> Keep communication open with the right people to make sure everyone knows what is happening.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">In the UK, the laws for scattering ashes are quite flexible, but <strong>public places – such as parks, beaches or tourist attractions – often have extra guidelines</strong>. For example, if your loved one wanted to be laid to rest at Stonehenge, you could only spread their ashes on the land around the stones, not in the inner Stone Circle. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>Meanwhile, if you were taking the ashes to a garden or estate, there may be rules about the time of day or the areas you’re able to visit.</strong> Wherever you choose, Google ‘spreading ashes at [NAME OF PLACE]’ to see if there are specific guidelines you need to be aware of.</p>

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">The ocean is a popular place to scatter ashes, and for good reason. There’s something poetic about watching your person’s ashes drift out to sea – especially if they loved the water. However, <strong>if you’ve chosen a spot that’s within five miles of the coast, the Environmental Agency asks that you stick to a few key rules. These include:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<ul style="font-size:17px"><li>Don’t scatter any non-biodegradable items with the ashes. For instance, personal items or plastic wreaths that may be harmful to wildlife.</li><li>Spread ashes at a spot far from buildings and where people swim or fish.</li><li>Spread the ashes as close to the water surface as possible.</li><li>Avoid windy days so the ashes don’t blow about and affect people living or working nearby.</li></ul>

<p style="font-size:17px">You can probably picture it now. If your loved one had a favourite place, and it’s possible to get to, consider scattering their ashes there. There are few better tributes than laying someone to rest in the spot where they spent their best moments.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Or choose numerous places</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">You can keep hold of the ashes for as long as you like, so if you want to, you can wait for a special date to do the scattering. Perhaps it could be on your person’s birthday or an anniversary that meant something to you both. It could even form part of memorialising them on a <a href="http://untanglegrief.com/death-anniversary/">death anniversary</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>5. Prepare a speech</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">If you’re scattering your loved one’s ashes as a group, it could be nice to prepare a speech. Just a few words or a heartfelt reading – or even a funny story – to bring a sense of ceremony to the day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>6. Take it in turns</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">Make others feel involved by taking turns scattering the ashes. This way, everyone gets their chance to say their own goodbye. These kinds of rituals can also make you feel closer to one another; you’re in it together to share support and pay tribute to someone you all love.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>7. Play some music</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">When the time comes to scatter the ashes, some music can be comforting. Depending on where you’re spreading them, take some mini speakers with you and play some of your loved one’s favourite songs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>8. Scatter flowers with the ashes</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">If you’re spreading your loved one’s ashes on the water or scattering them into the wind, you could also add flower petals with a symbolic meaning behind them. </p>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">Or you could simply go with their favourite flavours, whatever they may be. Some have even scattered wildflower seeds with ashes so that their love can continue to grow.</p>

<h3><strong>9. Make a day of it</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">After you’ve finished scattering your loved one’s ashes, and you’ve made your loving tributes, you may want nothing more than to go home and process the day. That said, if there’s time, you could always turn it into a full day out with those closest to you. Visit other places that meant something to you both, or maybe go to their favourite restaurant and raise a glass in their honour.</p>

<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>Should you invest in a pre-paid funeral plan?</strong> There are definitely benefits, but before you commit to any arrangements or costs, <strong>it’s essential to weigh up pre-paid funeral plans pros and cons first</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px"><a href="https://untanglegrief.com/our-advice-for-planning-a-funeral/">Funeral planning</a> can be difficult for grieving loved ones – to say the very least. Not only might they worry about what you would have wanted, but there’s the financial stress to deal with too. If you think they might struggle (and you feel able to take it on), a prepaid plan could give you all peace of mind. Discuss it with them to see if it’s something they would be open to.</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">If you have specific wishes for your funeral, a prepaid plan allows you to ensure they happen. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">For example, if there’s a particular coffin or venue type you’d prefer for the service, these can be paid for in advance.<strong> Some providers will also help you arrange the celebrant, vehicles, crematorium fees, and other add-ons.</strong> It all depends on the budget available and the plan you choose.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></div></div>
<!-- /wp:media-text -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>Finer details that don’t come at a cost – like a certain dress code or reading – may not be guaranteed.</strong> However, you can still make sure they’re noted and passed on to your loved ones, so they know exactly what you want. <strong>Before you make any payments, double-check exactly what is included in your plan.</strong> That way you’ll know what needs to be arranged separately.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3,"style":{"color":{"text":"#003946"},"typography":{"fontSize":"30px"}}} -->
<h3 class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:30px"><strong>3. Rising funeral costs can be avoided</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"},"color":{"text":"#003946"}}} -->
<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px">Inflation means that funeral prices are likely to go up in the coming months and years. However, by arranging a pre-paid plan, you can fix the balance so that you only pay the current price. <strong>You’re essentially ‘protecting’ your funeral against rising costs during difficult financial times</strong>, which means your loved ones won’t have to worry about finding the funds later on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3,"style":{"color":{"text":"#003946"},"typography":{"fontSize":"30px"}}} -->
<h3 class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:30px"><strong>4. You can pick a plan to suit your budget</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>Most pre-paid funeral providers offer a range of plans to suit every budget</strong>, so you can figure out an arrangement that works just for you. Loved ones can find it challenging to make financial decisions when emotional and grieving, so having the budget set and covered ahead of time will save a lot of upset and stress later on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3,"style":{"color":{"text":"#003946"},"typography":{"fontSize":"30px"}}} -->
<h3 class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:30px"><strong>5. Some providers let you pay on finance</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"},"color":{"text":"#003946"}}} -->
<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px">You don’t have to have the complete funds for the funeral ready right now. <strong>Many pre-paid plan providers allow you to pay over a 12-month period, often in interest-free instalments.</strong> There may be a small deposit to cover at the beginning, but this isn’t an additional cost; it will be deducted from your final total.</p>

<p style="font-size:17px">While a pre-paid funeral plan can cover a lot of your wishes, there are some details that can’t be included. Things like the music played, for example, might not be guaranteed on the day. <strong>The following is also not usually included in a pre-paid funeral plan:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->

<!-- /wp:list --></div></div>
<!-- /wp:media-text -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"},"color":{"text":"#003946"}}} -->
<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px"><strong>If you pay for your plan and then move abroad, or even to just another part of the country, you may not be able to move your funeral plans with you.</strong> This isn’t the case for all providers, but if you think you might move, you should check with them first. Make sure you know how flexible your plan is and whether there are any surprise conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3,"style":{"color":{"text":"#003946"},"typography":{"fontSize":"30px"}}} -->
<h3 class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:30px"><strong>3. You have to have the money ready</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">It goes without saying that funerals come at a cost. Without a plan, they’re usually paid for from your estate, but with a pre-paid plan, you need to have enough money ready to cover the price. The good news is, (as mentioned above) many providers allow you to make monthly instalments if you don’t want to pay the total upfront. This way, you can spread out the cost over a set period of time to make it more manageable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3,"style":{"color":{"text":"#003946"},"typography":{"fontSize":"30px"}}} -->
<h3 class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:30px"><strong>4. You can't withdraw funds once they're paid</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"color":{"text":"#003946"},"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px">When money is paid into a funeral plan, the funds are no longer accessible. Usually, they can’t be released again until death (but check contracts to be sure). You probably know this already, but it’s helpful to be aware of it before you start paying. That way you can make sure you’re budgeting correctly and not relying on that money for anything else.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3,"style":{"color":{"text":"#003946"},"typography":{"fontSize":"30px"}}} -->
<h3 class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:30px"><strong>5. Funeral plans may not go ahead</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"color":{"text":"#003946"},"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p class="has-text-color" style="color:#003946;font-size:17px"><strong>If you pay for the funeral in monthly instalments but pass away before the total balance is covered, many plan providers will not be able to go forward with your funeral wishes</strong>. Instead, your loved ones will usually be refunded, and they will need to start plans from scratch at the current rate. If you believe your death may be imminent, consider whether it’s better for your family or friends to make the plans instead.</p>

		Legacy Gifting & Inheritance Tax

<p style="font-size:17px">Giving gifts of toys, jewellery, or aftershave during a holiday celebration is one thing, but if you’re considering gifting money from your estate to your family or friends, maybe to help them with buying a property or perhaps to reduce any future Inheritance Tax bill, then there are specific rules and factors to consider, as sometimes being too generous can have its drawbacks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>Nowadays, giving a helping hand financially is something that most parents and grandparents want to do for their children and grandchildren. Making gifts during your lifetime reduces the value of your estate and as such can reduce the amount of Inheritance Tax that may be due after death.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What gifts are free from Inheritance Tax?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">There are a few ‘lifetime gifts’ that you can make that are immediately free from Inheritance Tax:&nbsp;<strong> Any gifts made to your English-domiciled spouse or to UK-registered charities are tax-free</strong>. <strong>You can give up to £3000 away each tax year</strong> either as a single gift or as several gifts added together, and you can also use any unused allowance from the previous tax year. &nbsp;<strong>Small gifts of up to £250 each can be made to as many people as you wish as long as no other gifts were made to them</strong>, and l<strong>arger amounts can be gifted on marriage</strong>; up to £5000 from a parent; up to £2500 from a grandparent and up to £1000 from anyone else.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">You are also able to make gifts out of your income as long as this is a regular payment, and you are able to maintain your usual standard of living.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>For other lifetime gifts to be successful in mitigating Inheritance Tax certain conditions must be met.</strong> If you survive seven years after giving away any asset (including money in excess of the amounts explained above) and you have not continued to benefit from the asset, then the gift will be exempt from Inheritance Tax. If you fail to survive seven years but manage to survive three or more years after the gift, then any Inheritance Tax that needs to be paid may be reduced on a sliding scale.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>The rules surrounding gifting and Inheritance Tax are complex and there are a number of matters to be wary of.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">It may be that if you give away an asset but later require care, the Local Authority may allege that you deliberately deprived yourself of those assets in an attempt to avoid paying care fees.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Can I transfer my home to my children?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>Families frequently contact us because they want to transfer their family home into the names of their children, to avoid future care fees or reduce any Inheritance Tax that may be due.</strong>&nbsp; As already stated, it is very likely that the Local Authority would consider this to be an attempt at deliberate deprivation of your assets and they would treat you as if you still owned the property when assessing what you need to pay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">Likewise, <strong>if you put your house in your children’s names but continue living in the house (and therefore continue to benefit from it) when you die the whole value of the property would still be included in your estate for Inheritance Tax purposes.&nbsp; </strong>And if your children&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;live in the property then when it is eventually sold they could be subject to Capital Gains Tax, if the value of the property has increased since the transfer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>Other matters to consider include the consequence of transferring your property to a child who then may be made subject to a bankruptcy order or may become unemployed and forced to sell the house to release the capital.</strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">If married, whilst your child may seem to be in a stable relationship, what would happen if they decided to divorce? The house would then form part of the divorce settlement and you could be left without a roof over your head! &nbsp;Similarly, what if your child predeceased you and left the house to their spouse who subsequently remarried?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>Whilst you may be full of good intentions when making gifts to your loved ones, it is important to seek professional legal advice so that your kindness and generosity doesn’t lead to disappointment and despair.</strong></p>

		How to Manage Debts after a Bereavement
		https://untanglegrief.com/how-to-manage-debts-after-a-bereavement/
		Tue, 03 Jan 2023 12:07:51 +0000

		<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">The death of someone close to you is bound to have devastating effects on your entire life. During bereavement, many people are affected emotionally, mentally, and financially. <strong>If you have been left with debt after a loved one passes away, it is important to take steps to manage this debt in a way that is responsible and sustainable.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">It is understandable for you to feel unsure about what happens to a person’s debts or assets when they die. We have provided some guidance below around taking those first steps at managing debts after a bereavement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>What is debt?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">Debt is an amount of money that is owed by one person or entity to another. This can be in the form of a loan, a credit card balance, or any other type of financial obligation. <strong>When someone takes on debt, they are agreeing to pay back the money that they have borrowed, along with any associated interest or fees.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">Debt can be useful in certain situations, as it allows people to borrow money to make purchases or investments that they may not have the cash to pay for upfront. However, if not managed properly, debt can also become a burden, as the borrower may have difficulty making the required payments.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>My loved one has left debts behind after they died. What do I do?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">First, it is important to understand what debts your loved one has left behind. This may include things like credit card debt, mortgage debt, car loan debt, and personal loan debt. It is important to carefully review all these debts and to understand the terms and conditions associated with them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>Once you have a clear picture of the debts your loved one has left behind, it is important to prioritise them.</strong> Some debts, such as mortgage debt and car loan debt, may be secured against assets, which means that the lender has the right to repossess those assets if the debt is not repaid. In these cases, it may be necessary to prioritise these debts and to make sure that they are paid on time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>In some cases, it may be possible to negotiate with creditors to try and reduce the amount of debt that is owed.</strong> For example, if your loved one had a credit card with a high interest rate, you may be able to negotiate a lower rate with the credit card company. This can help to reduce the amount of interest that is being charged on the debt, which can make it more manageable. It is also important to consider your own financial situation when managing debt after a bereavement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>If you are not able to manage the debt on your own, you may need to seek help from a financial advisor or a debt counselling service.</strong> These professionals can provide you with guidance and support to help you manage your debt in a way that is sustainable and responsible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>When should I get help?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">It is important to get help with debts as soon as possible after a bereavement, even if you are not sure how you will be able to manage them. There are a few key reasons why it is important to seek help with your debts after a bereavement:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<ul style="font-size:17px"><li>To understand if/how this affects your own financial situation</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<ul style="font-size:17px"><li>To prioritise certain debts: Not all debts are created equal, and it is important to prioritise them in order to manage them effectively</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<ul style="font-size:17px"><li>To inform and potentially negotiate with creditors: The creditors should be informed as soon as you feel that you are able to discuss the debts</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">Debt concerns can add a high amount of stress during such a difficult period of your life. <strong>Although it is important to seek help with your debts as soon as possible after a bereavement, you must go at your own pace.</strong> If you do not feel like you are able to discuss the matters over the phone, it is possible to communicate with creditors online.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>The emotional impact of being in debt</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">Whether you have to manage a loved one’s debts after they have died, or whether you are managing your own debts, you will likely experience a significant emotional impact. The burden of debt can weigh heavily on individuals and can lead to feelings of hopelessness and despair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">One of the major emotional impacts of being in debt is the sense of financial insecurity it can create. If you are in debt, you may worry about how you will be able to make your monthly payments, or how you will be able to pay off your debts in full. This is extremely normal and is called <strong>debt fatigue</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">In some cases, the emotional impact of being in debt can be so severe that it leads to mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety. These conditions can make it even more difficult for you to manage their debts, as you may be unable to think clearly about your finances.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>How can I get help?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">There are a variety of ways that you can seek out help and support.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

		Making a Will – what are your options?
		https://untanglegrief.com/making-a-will-what-are-your-options/
		Tue, 03 Jan 2023 13:05:30 +0000

		<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">Making a Will is a positive act which will greatly assist your loved ones when you pass away. By making a Will, you can have peace of mind in the knowledge that your wishes shall be carried out. <strong>With a little planning, you can ensure that your wealth and the gifts you wish to make reach the right people at the right time with tax being minimised where possible.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">Without a Will:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<ul style="font-size:17px"><li>Your assets shall pass in accordance with the Intestacy Rules, which does not necessarily mean that your assets shall pass to those whom you consider closest to you.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<ul style="font-size:17px"><li>You will not pass any assets to people who are not directly related to you, including step-children, common law spouses, or to your favourite charities.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<ul style="font-size:17px"><li>If you are separated but not divorced, your estranged spouse could still inherit and be responsible for administering your estate.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<ul style="font-size:17px"><li>You will have no say in who will look after your children if they are under 18 when you die.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<ul style="font-size:17px"><li>You will have no control over the age at which your beneficiaries shall inherit.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<ul style="font-size:17px"><li>There could be increased cost and delay in administering your estate.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">It is not practical for couples to make “joint Wills” as, with these Wills, both parties must be in agreement for the Wills to be changed or revoked. Thereafter, when one partner dies, the joint Will automatically becomes irrevocable, meaning the survivor’s Will cannot be changed from that point on. <strong>Couples are advised to make individual Wills, even if both Wills say the same things</strong>, and these are commonly known as “mirror Wills”.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Executors and Trustees</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">These are the people who will have the legal authority and responsibility for administering your estate and carrying out your wishes. If your asset base is complicated, this can be quite an onerous task covering a whole range of matters. <strong>You should appoint people who are over the age of 18, who you trust implicitly, and who are financially astute.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">It is not uncommon for independent professional Executors and Trustees, such as a solicitor or a solicitors' firm, to be appointed either for the assistance of their beneficiaries or to ensure that there is fairness in executing the terms of the Will in practice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">The people who you appoint as your Executors will usually also be appointed as the Trustees of any trusts which might arise under your Will. However, separate people can be appointed to perform these roles if desired.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Options for your estate</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">It is important that your Will sets out who is to receive whatever property has not otherwise been dealt with in your Will. <strong>All of the assets you own at your death that have not already been gifted in your Will, after any liabilities have been paid, form your residuary estate</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">When thinking about who should benefit from your residuary estate, please remember that it cannot be predicted in what order people will die. <strong>Accordingly, you might want to make provision for your beneficiaries’ families, should a particular beneficiary die before you.</strong> This is often thought of in the context of somebody leaving their estate (or part of it) to their grandchildren if their child has pre-deceased them. As such, you need to consider what age you wish younger beneficiaries to inherit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>There are two main options for dealing with your residuary estate in your Will.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>First, you could create a basic Will</strong> which passes your estate outright to your chosen beneficiaries (at a predetermined age, if appropriate). A basic Will is simple and the benefits are that the beneficiary will have unrestricted access to and absolute control of the assets they inherit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>However, it is important to consider the fact that you do not know the date on which you will pass away, and you therefore do not know what your beneficiaries’ circumstances will be at that date</strong>. There is a considerable danger your beneficiaries will inherit a sizeable amount when a number of factors might make that inappropriate. For example, the beneficiary may be going through a divorce or a breakdown in relationship, tax issues, bankruptcy, gambling/alcohol/drug addiction, etc.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>In order to offer more protection for your estate once you have passed away, you could instead incorporate a trust structure within your Will</strong>. The trust would be designed to benefit your chosen beneficiaries, but with the ability for the people managing the trust (the “Trustees”) to decide when/if funds are distributed. This can be extremely valuable, as the Trustees can provide financial support as appropriate, but whilst retaining/restricting access to the capital if there is good reason to do so.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>A Will of this nature would be accompanied by a “Letter of Wishes” – a document setting out your intentions.</strong> This is not legally binding (as making it binding would undermine the discretion which is crucial to the protection), but it is highly persuasive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Other matters to consider when making a Will</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">You should also consider whether you would like to leave any specific items or specific amounts of money to certain individuals. Furthermore, if you have children under the age of 18, you should ensure that you appoint guardians in your Will to set out who you would intend to take parental responsibility for those children in the event of both parents passing away. You can also set out your funeral wishes within your Will, if you should so wish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>Not only does making a Will give you peace of mind that you have adequately accounted for your wishes for your estate after death,</strong> but Wills can also be extremely useful for mitigating against tax for both your own estate and the estates of your chosen beneficiaries for generations to come.</p>

		Probate without a Will - Letters of Administration
		https://untanglegrief.com/letters-of-administration/
		Tue, 03 Jan 2023 18:31:59 +0000

		<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">When somebody passes away without having made a Will, the rules of intestacy apply and so the law will dictate who has the authority to deal with the estate and benefit from the estate. <strong>The rules of intestacy are extremely strict and often leave people’s estates being dealt with by and distributed to individuals that the deceased had never intended.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">Somebody who passes away without making a will is known as “intestate”. The individuals who are entitled to deal with the estate are called the administrators and the individuals who are entitled to benefit from the estate are called the beneficiaries. Other than spouses, civil partners, and adopted children, only close living blood relatives of the deceased can benefit from the intestate’s estate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Spouse/civil partners</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">Where an individual was married or in a civil partnership when they passed away, the surviving spouse/civil partner will inherit the first £270,000 of the estate, half of the remainder of the estate, and all of the personal belongings of the deceased. For example, if somebody’s estate was worth £300,000 when they passed away and they were married at their death, the surviving spouse would receive the first £285,000 of that person’s estate (along with personal items). If the deceased had children, they would be entitled to the remainder of the estate. If the deceased was co-habiting with their partner, and they were not married or in a civil partnership, they would not be entitled to any of the estate under the rules of intestacy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Children</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">If the person who has passed away was not married but had a child or children who survived them, then the child or children would inherit the entire estate (in equal shares if more than one child). Children do not receive their inheritance immediately if they are under the age of 18. They would only receive the inheritance upon turning 18, or if they got married or formed a civil partnership before that age. The administrators would deal with the inheritance on behalf of the child until they were entitled to the funds themselves. It should be noted that children born from unmarried relationships rank equally with children born in marital relationships.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">Step-children are not entitled to a share of a deceased step-parents estate, unless they had been formally adopted by the deceased.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Grandchildren and great-grandchildren</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">Under the rules of intestacy, a grandchild or a great-grandchild would only be entitled to receive a share of a deceased’s estate if their parent or grandparent had died before the intestate person, or if their parent is alive when the deceased passes away but dies before reaching the age of 18 without marrying/forming a civil partnership.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Other close blood relatives</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">If the deceased passed away leaving no spouse, civil partner, children, grandchildren or great-grandchildren, then the next closest living relatives who will be entitled to inherit are the intestate’s siblings (including half-siblings), parents and grandparents, uncles and aunts (or cousins where the deceased’s uncle or aunt has passed away before them) and half-uncles and half-aunts (and again, half-cousins if the deceased’s half-uncle or half-aunt has passed away before them).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Where there are no surviving relatives</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">If somebody passes away without a Will leaving no surviving close blood relatives, that person’s estate will then pass to the Crown. This is known as “<em>bona vacantia</em>”, which is a term that refers to unclaimed goods.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Dealing with the Probate of an intestate person – “Letters of Administration”</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">Whoever is entitled to benefit from the estate (with reference to the above) would then be the individual(s) with the authority to deal with the estate – namely, the administrator or administrators. <strong>The administrators would need to apply for Letters of Administration (often referred to as Probate) so that they can be formally appointed by the court to deal with the affairs of the deceased.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">The administrator would take responsibility for dealing with all aspects of the estate including:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<ul style="font-size:17px"><li>Notifying relevant organisations about the death;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<ul style="font-size:17px"><li>Ascertaining the assets and liabilities of the deceased;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<ul style="font-size:17px"><li>Making an application for the Letters of Administration;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<ul style="font-size:17px"><li>&nbsp;Paying any inheritance tax that is owed;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<ul style="font-size:17px"><li>Collecting assets and paying liabilities;</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<ul style="font-size:17px"><li>Producing estate accounts to set out the assets and liabilities in the estate as well as what will be due for distribution to the beneficiaries; and</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<ul style="font-size:17px"><li>Making distributions to beneficiaries.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px">Dealing with an estate can be burdensome, and administrators have the option of appointing professionals, such as a solicitors firm, to assist them with the process if required.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"17px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:17px"><strong>Passing away without a Will can often lead to devastating consequences if the rules of intestacy do not accurately reflect what the wishes of the deceased would be.</strong> Not only this, but distribution of an estate in accordance with the rules of intestacy can have significantly adverse tax implications.</p>

		Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPAs)
		https://untanglegrief.com/lasting-powers-of-attorney-lpas/
		Thu, 12 Jan 2023 12:48:35 +0000
		team
		https://untanglegrief.com/?p=4939
		
		<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPAs) allow you (the Donor) to appoint one or more people (known as Attorneys) the legal authority to make decisions on your behalf, about your financial affairs and health and welfare, if you were to lose mental capacity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many believe that Lasting Powers of Attorney are only needed as you get older – but this is simply not the case, as it may be an accident, or sudden illness that renders you unable to make your own decisions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Lasting Power of Attorney can only be made while the person making it is deemed to still have the mental capacity to make their own decisions and understand what they are agreeing to. If no attorneys have been appointed, and the person’s mental capacity deteriorates to a point where it is no longer possible to make an LPA, the Court of Protection would have to appoint a Deputy to deal with any financial matters, and medical staff and Social Services would be responsible for making Health and Welfare decisions on the person’s behalf. This can cause untold distress to both you and to your loved ones, creating problems that could easily have been avoided.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are two types of Lasting Power of Attorney:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Property &amp; Financial Affairs LPA</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This allows your attorney (who will be a responsible person or persons of your choosing) to manage your financial and property affairs. This means you can authorise them to write cheques on your behalf, pay bills or claim benefits for you. By planning ahead, you are able to give your instructions while you are of sound mind, and in anticipation of the possibility of not being capable at some future date. This provides invaluable peace-of-mind in the unfortunate eventuality of you being rendered incapable of managing your own affairs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Health &amp; Welfare LPA</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This allows you to authorise someone to make health and welfare decisions for you and can only be used if you lose the necessary mental capacity to do this for yourself. Your attorney will be then able to make decisions about where you live and your day-to-day care, having already discussed this with you.&nbsp; They will also be able to refuse or consent to medical treatment on your behalf if you desire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If mental capacity is lost and there are no Lasting Powers of Attorney in existence, then any bank accounts would be frozen, even if held jointly, and an application would have to be made to the Court of Protection which is a lengthy, expensive process during which time no money can leave the account to pay bills or fund care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An LPA can be made at any time but has to be registered with the Office of the Public Guardian before it can be used – and in current circumstances this can take up to 20 weeks.&nbsp; However, once it is registered it is available for use as soon as it is needed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you were struck down by sudden illness or disability (for example, from a stroke or an accident) and did not have Lasting Powers of Attorney in place, there would inevitably be considerable delays before any financial matters could be dealt with or important decisions about your care could be made.&nbsp; An application to the Court of Protection for a Deputyship can only be made once a person with no Attorney in place has lost capacity, which means a delay of 6 months or more before the Court Order is issued and the Deputy can be of any assistance – a time-consuming, expensive and frustrating exercise which could have been avoided.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think of it like travel insurance - you hope you won’t ever need to use it but would not consider going on holiday without it. Your Attorney may never need to use the LPA, but if you were unable to look after your affairs and do not have one in place, the alternative does not bear thinking about.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s never too early to make one, just don’t leave it too late!</p>

		Do you need to put Lasting Powers of Attorney in place?
		https://untanglegrief.com/do-you-need-to-put-lasting-powers-of-attorney-in-place/

		<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Lasting Power of Attorney is a document that allows you to appoint people or professionals that you trust to manage your affairs and make decisions on your behalf. A person who makes a Lasting Power of Attorney is called a donor, and a person or a professional who is appointed under a Lasting Power of Attorney is known as an attorney. Lasting Powers of Attorney can be extremely useful for planning for your future, for example if you were to ever have an accident, or suffer an illness such as dementia, heart disease or a stroke.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are two forms of Lasting Powers of Attorney, one which covers Property and Financial Affairs and a second which covers Health and Welfare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Lasting Power of Attorney covering Health and Welfare<strong> </strong>allows your chosen attorneys to make health and welfare decisions on the donor’s behalf but only at a time in the future when the donor lacks capacity to make such decisions. Such decisions may include those concerning what medical treatment you receive and whether you should receive life-sustaining medical care. Attorneys appointed under a Health and Welfare Lasting Power of Attorney can also make decisions about where you live (i.e., whether you should move into a care home) and decisions about your daily routine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A Lasting Power of Attorney covering Property and Financial Affairs<strong> </strong>allows your chosen attorneys to make decisions about your finances and property either straight away (once the document is in place), or at a time in the future when you are unable to or lack the capacity to make such decisions.&nbsp; Under this document, your chosen attorneys can manage your bank and building society accounts, sell your property (where necessary), pay your bills and collect your pensions and benefits for you. You might feel more comfortable appointing a professional attorney to act for you under this type of Lasting Power of Attorney, as they would have particular knowledge and expertise that could help to reduce the burden on your family and friends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you do not put Lasting Powers of Attorney in place when you have capacity, and then you later lose capacity to make decisions on your behalf, the only way that your trusted individuals will be able to manage your financial affairs would be for them to make an application to court for a Deputyship order. This process is likely to be both extremely lengthy and costly. A similar application is (in practice) almost impossible to achieve for health or welfare decisions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you want to ensure that your trusted individuals can make decisions for you on your behalf in the future when you might not be able to make them yourself, you should definitely consider putting Lasting Powers of Attorney in place.</p>

<p><strong>One of the most challenging parts of <a href="/our-advice-for-planning-a-funeral/">funeral planning</a> is writing a fitting tribute to your loved one.</strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>How can you find the words to capture just how much your friend or family member means to you? It’s harder still because you’re grieving, so emotions are running high, concentration is low, and the pressure may be overwhelming. <strong>That’s why we’ve created this guide on how to write a eulogy, complete with examples to get you started. </strong></p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-left has-large-font-size"><strong>What is a eulogy?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>A eulogy is a short speech given at a funeral or <a href="/how-to-memorial-ceremony/">memorial service</a> for a person who has died. </strong>The tradition originates from ancient Greece, and the word literally means “praise”. The key is to write the eulogy in a way that does their life justice and respects their loved ones’ memories and feelings of grief.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"textAlign":"left","fontSize":"large"} -->
<h2 class="has-text-align-left has-large-font-size"><strong>Who should deliver a eulogy?</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking about someone who has died in front of their family and friends is a courageous thing to do. If you feel daunted by the prospect, ask people around you for support. <strong>While a close relative or friend usually writes the funeral speech, it can also be delivered by an official, such as a religious leader.</strong> Do what feels right and keep it flexible. For example, if you want to write the eulogy but worry about <a href="/preparing-yourself-for-the-funeral/">breaking down in tears</a>, ask someone else to be on standby to read it for you if need be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2 class="has-text-align-left has-large-font-size" id="tips"><strong>How to write a eulogy - 6 tips</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>1. Make it personal</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Introducing yourself in relation to the person you are remembering can be a good place to start.</strong> Describe what they meant to you, and what qualities defined them in your eyes. This will establish a connection with other people at the service and put you in the picture for those who might not know you very well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>2. Cover the essentials</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When thinking about how to write a eulogy, it’s a good idea to structure it with a beginning, a middle and an end. And while it is not the same as an obituary, <strong>it usually includes brief aspects of the late person’s life, such as their early beginnings, their education and career, and particular skills, achievements or interests.</strong> Saying something specific about their family life, and mentioning their partner and/or children by name, can feel particularly important to their closest relatives.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>3. Get personal stories from others</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just like our relationships with a particular person differ, so do our <a href="/stages-of-grief/">feelings about them when they die</a>. To make sure you write a good eulogy that will feel meaningful to others, <strong>ask a few close friends or relatives to contribute by sharing a favourite memory, personal story, or anecdote</strong>. A range of perspectives will enrich your speech and help strike the right tone right with your audience. You might also discover a true gem in the process, like a beautiful quote that perfectly captures your loved one’s personality, qualities, and quirks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>4. Consider the length</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How long should a eulogy be?<strong> Some funeral speeches are very brief and there are no set rules for length, but 3-5 minutes is common.</strong> Make it long enough to properly honour the person and say what needs to be said, in proportion to the rest of the funeral service. To get it right, try reading it out loud a few times while timing yourself and editing accordingly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>5. Make it honest</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is possible to talk about someone’s achievements and qualities without glorifying them and mention shortcomings or disappointments in a kind and accepting way. None of us are perfect, and we remember those we have lost in all their human complexity. <strong>Follow your instincts, even using some gentle humour if it feels right and relevant.</strong> And if you’re not sure, ask someone else for their honest feedback before you finalise your eulogy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3><strong>6. End on a touching note</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ending a eulogy on the right note can be tricky. <strong>One option is to finish with a poem or <a href="/the-35-greatest-grief-quotes/">quote</a> that feels consoling and meaningful, even if it happens to come from a movie such as <em>Pretty Woman</em> or <em>Lord of the Rings</em>!</strong> You might find inspiration in famous eulogies, such as Matthew’s tribute to his partner Gareth in <em>Four Weddings and a Funeral</em>, Oprah Winfrey’s speech for Rosa Parks, Mona Simpson remembering her brother Steve Jobs, or in books and online quote collections.</p>

If you are not - you will need to get a new policy in place. Most policies terminate on the death of the main 
policy holder, and this will leave you uninsured. 

To cancel or change policy: 
Call them 0345 246 8706

Next task:  Notify utilities & broadband 

Step 1:  decide what you need to do with each account 
Each provider has their own policies with cancelling accounts. 
In most cases, you will need to pay an outstanding balance or 
if it was a contract, you might need to pay up until the end of 
the contract. 
If you are planning on selling the property, we recommend 
keeping the utility accounts (gas, water, electric) and 
changing the account details into your name.  
If the bills were paid from your joint bank 
account: 
Your account will continue as normal, if you decide to 
keep that joint payment account. 
If you want to cancel the account If the payment comes from the deceased 
account: 
If you have previously notiﬁed the bank, your loved one’s 
bank account most likely will be frozen. Therefore, you’ll 
need to contact the company and change the payment 
details so that it comes from your account instead. If the account is solely in the deceased's name 
and you want to continue the policy : 
You will need to ask the company if you can change this. 
Occasionally, you may be asked to create a new account in a 
new name but this varies depending on the company policy. 
If the account is in both your name and 
theirs: 
You might want this changed but it can be done later on 
if you have more pressing things to be done. 
Once this is decided, you can get onto contacting the companies. In the following pages, we have curated 
speciﬁc information for how to contact each of the utility & broadband companies you entered in your sign up.

Probate:  do I need it? 
What is probate? 
An Executor of a person’s will needs to obtain a Grant of Probate to be legally entitled to distribute their loved one’s assets 
in accordance to the will.  Grant of Probate should be applied by the executor for within the ﬁrst few months of your loved 
one’s death, as it may be necessary to obtain in order to access and close certain accounts that your loved one held. 
How do I know if I need to do it?  
You will likely need to apply for Grant of Probate if any  of the 
following apply to you: 
● If your loved one had any assets overseas - this includes 
property or ﬁnancial accounts 
● If your loved one had assets over £10,000  that were not 
jointly owned e.g stocks, shares, savings 
● If the value of the your loved one’s estate (everything they 
owned) is more than £10,000  - this includes property, money 
and possessions. Each bank has its own threshold to 
determine whether you need Probate to access your loved 
one’s account with them. The information about 
thresholds for each bank are on the next page. 
You don’t need to do it if: 
●The person had no assets outside 
the UK 
●All assets were jointly owned (eg. Mr 
& Mrs Jones’s bank account) 
●The value of the estate is less than  
£10,000  - but make sure you check 
with the ﬁnancial providers! 
 If this is you, you have come to 
the end of your tasks. Well done!

Probate:  doing it on your own vs using a solicitor 
On your own 
You could save a large amount of 
money. The application fee costs 
£215, and there is no charge for 
estates under £5000. 
The process can be relatively 
straightforward to complete if you 
have all the right information to 
hand, and you can apply online 
You have full control of any 
decisions that need to be made 
The forms contain a lot of legal jargon 
and can be complicated to understand 
Getting access to certain accounts can 
be easier when represented by a 
solicitor 
If you make a mistake you will be held 
accountable,  and this can  delay the 
probate process 
Using a solicitor 
Using a solicitor can ease some 
of the strain of dealing with the 
paperwork and save you time 
They are much better equipped to 
deal with complicated estates 
Grant of probate is a legal 
document, using a professional 
might give you peace of mind it’s 
done correctly 
Solicitors can be expensive, 
and fees can quickly mount 
up 
Sometimes it can be hard to 
ﬁnd a solicitor you trust, 
with a good reputation.

What is included in the estate? 
An estate is everything your loved one owned. This includes property, money in their ﬁnancial accounts and possessions. 
Once you have a rough estimation of your loved one’s ﬁnancial situation , continue to the next page. You ﬁrst need to value the money and ﬁnancial assets your loved one owned 
1. You might have already contacted all the ﬁnancial organisations your loved one held accounts with. 
Just as a reminder, organisations to contact often include: 
○ Their bank or building society - ask them to freeze any payments into or out of the account 
○ Their pension provider 
○ Any companies with which they held stocks or shares 
○ Their employer - they may be owed wages 
2. For each of the organisations you have contacted, ask for a statement of the value of their assets and any debts 
they held. If they had a mortgage, ask the mortgage lender if they require payments to continue whilst you are 
completing the Probate process. 
3. Make a list of all the information you receive from the ﬁnancial account providers. Make sure to include any 
lump sums from pensions or life insurance. 
Probate Step 1:  estimate the value of the estate (Part 1) 

Add everything up from Step 1 and 2, and you now have an estimate of the value of your loved one’s estate. Step 3 is 
working out if you need to pay Inheritance Tax, you can ﬁnd information about this is on the next page. You now need to value your loved one’s possessions 
1. Make a list of all the possessions they owned, and whether these were privately or jointly owned. Things to list 
could include: property, furniture, artwork, jewellery and cars. 
2. Next, estimate the value of each of these possessions on the day that your loved one died. This is a rough price 
that each item could be realistically sold for, not the price they paid. You can research this online, or get a 
professional valuation 
3. For jointly owned assets, divide the value by 2 if it was jointly owned with your loved one’s spouse or civil partner. 
For any assets owned by more than 2 people, divide the asset by the number of owners. 
4. To value a property: 
a. If you know the value is not close to the Inheritance Tax threshold of £325,000, you can value the property 
yourself by searching for it on Zoopla , or searching for the value of similar properties in the same area 
b. You can use a local estate agent, but if you think the property may be valued near to the Inheritance Tax 
threshold (£325,000), it is recommended that you use a chartered surveyor as they will have more 
experience valuing a property for Inheritance Tax purposes 
Probate Step 2:  estimate the value of the estate (Part 2) 

What is it? 
Inheritance Tax (IHT) is a tax you have to pay on the estate of someone who has died. It includes all their property, 
possessions and money. It needs to be paid by the Executor. Normally, IHT needs to be paid or partially paid before 
probate can be issued. However, there are some exceptions to this. 
If you need to pay Inheritance Tax, follow the step 4. If you do not then head straight to step 5. How do I know if I need to pay it? 
Probate Step 3:  do I need to pay Inheritance Tax? 
The amount of inheritance tax you need to pay will depend on a lot of factors that are unique to your situation, however 
there is normally no tax to be paid  if:
● The value of your estate is below of £325,000 - this is known as the Nil Rate Band (NRB) 
● You leave everything above the threshold to your spouse or civil partner, or 
● You leave everything above the threshold to an exempt beneﬁciary such as a charity 
If this is correct for you loved one’s estate - you still need to report this to HMRC. You can do this here: Valuing the estate of  
someone who's died: Report the estate's value to HMRC . Then, you can skip to Probate Step 5. 
If the estate is valued at over £325,000, there is usually tax to pay  on anything over this threshold at a rate of 40%. 
However, there are many exceptions to this. For more information, follow this link to the government website: Inheritance  
Tax - GOV.UK 
● Sometimes banks or building societies will release 
money out of your loved ones account before probate 
has been issued, if it is being used to pay IHT directly 
to HMRC. 
● if you are paying IHT on property, HMRC may accept 
staged payments so you can pay back IHT over a 
longer time frame. 
● If you pay for IHT out of your money, you can get a 
refund from the estate when probate is granted. 
1) Value your loved ones estate - Steps 1 and 2 
2) Decide whether it is likely that you will need to 
pay any Inheritance Tax based on the 
information in Step 3. 
3) Report the estimated value of the estate to 
HMRC (even if you will not need to pay 
Inheritance Tax): Valuing the estate of someone  
who's died: Report the estate's value to HMRC 
4) If you think you need to pay IHT, apply for a 
reference number (this needs to happen 3 
weeks before you make a payment): Pay your  
Inheritance Tax bill: Get a payment reference  
number  
5) Pay your inheritance tax: Pay your Inheritance  
Tax bill - GOV.UK 
Where do I get the money to pay 
Inheritance Tax? 
● Inheritance Tax (IHT) must be paid by the end of the 
sixth month after the person’s death. 
● HMRC will start charging interest on any unpaid tax 
after the 6-month period, so you should begin even if 
you haven’t valued the estate fully. 
● If you pay too much or little, it will be corrected after 
you receive probate (this is called payment on 
account). When do I need to pay it? How to pay Inheritance Tax: 
Probate Step 4:  paying your Inheritance Tax 

What do I need? 
Before you begin the Probate form you will 
need to gather the following: 
● The original will 
● The original death certiﬁcate or an 
interim death certiﬁcate from the 
coroner 
● A completed estimation and report of 
the value of the estate from HMRC, as 
completed in Step 1 and 2. 
● A notice from HMRC saying that you’ve 
either paid inheritance tax or have no 
tax to pay, as completed in Step 3 or 4 . 
○ This can be corrected if 
necessary after the Probate 
application is completed 
Ready to apply? The application fee is £215 if the value of the estate is £5,000 or over. 
There’s no application fee if the estate is under £5,000. 
Extra copies of the Grant of Probate cost £1.50 each. It is worth getting a 
few copies - we would recommend one for each account you still have to 
close, so you are able to send them to different organisations at the 
same time. This should help you to complete the process faster. 
Once you have gathered all the documents from the list on the left, 
you need to complete the PA1P form. You can check whether you are 
eligible to apply for a Grant of Probate online here: Apply for probate  
online 
If you are not eligible, you will need to submit the forms via post. You 
can ﬁnd the PA1P form here: Form PA1P: Apply for probate by post if  
there is a will 
Things to note: 
Probate Step 5:  it’s time to apply for Grant of Probate 

● Probate usually takes around 4 weeks to be granted, but may take longer at the moment due to coronavirus. 
● You may have already contacted ﬁnancial organisations to inform them of your loved one’s death, and the 
accounts should be frozen to stop payments going in or out of the account. You can now contact your loved 
one’s ﬁnancial account providers to inform them that you now have a Grant of Probate to act on their behalf. 
● Once you are able to access their accounts, this means you can now make a correct assessment of the value

Probate Step 6:  what happens next? 
Probate:  tips for using a solicitor 
Time is Money 
Some solicitors charge hourly rates, whilst others will 
charge a percentage of the total value of the estate. 
Most solicitors will give you a cost estimate at the 
start, based on how complex the estate is. 
Often the fees won’t include court or any application 
costs, so expect the ﬁnal bill to be higher than the 
estimated ﬁgure given at the start of the process. 
Time is money, so make sure your solicitor doesn’t 
waste time chasing you, and try to communicate via 
email as phone calls can last longer. 
Try to gather the 
documents yourself 
Having everything that your solicitor may need to 
hand will make delays much less likely. Most 
solicitors will ask for - documents. Make sure you trust them 
Sometimes it can be easier to use the solicitor 
who drew up the will, but if you have a preference 
for another provider, go with your gut instinct. 
Communication between you and your solicitor 
is important, so look at reviews online or ask for 
recommendations from friends and family. 
Don’t be afraid to ask 
questions 
The solicitor should check with you to make sure 
you’ve understood what they’ve said. Ask them to 
explain anything you don’t understand. Take notes 
of what is said or, if you are able, bring a friend or 
family member along to take notes for you. At the 
end of your appointment, make sure you know 
what the next steps are.

Letter of Administration:  do I need it? 
What is it? 
If your loved one died without making a will, you will need to apply for a Letter of Administration to be able to deal with 
their estate and distribute any assets. There are rules about who can do this, it is usually the deceased’s next-of-kin, such 
as a married partner or a child. You should apply for a Letter of Administration within the ﬁrst few months of your loved 
one’s death if you need to access or handle their accounts. 
How do I know if I need to do it?  
You will need to apply for a Letter of Administration if any of the following 
apply to you: 
● If your loved one had any assets overseas - this includes property 
or ﬁnancial accounts 
● If your loved one had assets over £10,000  that were not jointly 
owned e.g stocks, shares, savings 
● If the value of the your loved one’s estate (everything they owned) 
is more than £10,000 - this includes property, money and 
possessions. Each bank has its own threshold to determine 
whether you need Probate to access your loved one’s account with 
them. 
The information about thresholds for each bank are on the next page. 
You don’t need to do it if: 
●The person had no assets outside 
the UK 
●All assets were jointly owned (eg. Mr 
& Mrs Jones’s bank account) 
●The value of the estate is less than  
£10,000  - make sure you check with 
the ﬁnancial providers! 
 If this is you, you have come to 
the end of your tasks. Well done!

LoA:  doing it on your own vs using a solicitor 
On your own 
You could save a large amount of 
money. The application fee costs 
£215, and there is no charge for 
estates under £5000. 
The process can be relatively 
straightforward to complete if you 
have all the right information to 
hand, and you can apply online 
You have full control of any 
decisions that need to be made 
The forms contain a lot of legal jargon 
and can be complicated to understand 
Getting access to certain accounts can 
be easier when represented by a 
solicitor 
If you make a mistake you will be held 
accountable,  and this can  delay the 
probate process 
Using a solicitor 
Using a solicitor can ease some 
of the strain of dealing with the 
paperwork and save you time 
They are much better equipped to 
deal with complicated estates 
Grant of probate is a legal 
document, using a professional 
might give you peace of mind it’s 
done correctly 
Solicitors can be expensive, 
and fees can quickly mount 
up 
Sometimes it can be hard to 
ﬁnd a solicitor you trust, 
with a good reputation.

What is included in the estate? 
An estate is everything your loved one owned. This includes property, money in their ﬁnancial accounts and possessions. 
Once you have a rough estimation of your loved one’s ﬁnancial situation , continue to the next page. You ﬁrst need to value the money and ﬁnancial assets your loved one owned 
1. You might have already contacted all the ﬁnancial organisations your loved one held accounts with. 
Just as a reminder, organisations to contact often include: 
○ Their bank or building society - ask them to freeze any payments into or out of the account 
○ Their pension provider 
○ Any companies with which they held stocks or shares 
○ Their employer - they may be owed wages 
2. For each of the organisations you have contacted, ask for a statement of the value of their assets and any debts 
they held. If they had a mortgage, ask the mortgage lender if they require payments to continue whilst you are 
completing the Probate process. 
3. Make a list of all the information you receive from the ﬁnancial account providers. Make sure to include any 
lump sums from pensions or life insurance. 
LoA Step 1:  estimate the value of the estate (Part 1) 

Add everything up from Step 1 and 2, and you now have an estimate of the value of your loved one’s estate. Step 3 is 
working out if you need to pay Inheritance Tax, you can ﬁnd information about this is on the next page. You now need to value your loved one’s possessions 
1. Make a list of all the possessions they owned, and whether these were privately or jointly owned. Things to list 
could include: property, furniture, artwork, jewellery and cars. 
2. Next, estimate the value of each of these possessions on the day that your loved one died. This is a rough price 
that each item could be realistically sold for, not the price they paid. You can research this online, or get a 
professional valuation 
3. For jointly owned assets, divide the value by 2 if it was jointly owned with your loved one’s spouse or civil partner. 
For any assets owned by more than 2 people, divide the asset by the number of owners. 
4. To value a property: 
a. If you know the value is not close to the Inheritance Tax threshold of £325,000, you can value the property 
yourself by searching for it on Zoopla , or searching for the value of similar properties in the same area 
b. You can use a local estate agent, but if you think the property may be valued near to the Inheritance Tax 
threshold (£325,000), it is recommended that you use a chartered surveyor as they will have more 
experience valuing a property for Inheritance Tax purposes 
LoA Step 2:  estimate the value of the estate (Part 2) 

What is it? 
Inheritance Tax (IHT) is a tax you have to pay on the estate of someone who has died. It includes all their property, 
possessions and money. It needs to be paid by the Executor. Normally, IHT needs to be paid or partially paid before 
probate can be issued. However, there are some exceptions to this. 
If you need to pay Inheritance Tax, follow the step 4. If you do not then head straight to step 5. The amount of inheritance tax you need to pay will depend on a lot of factors that are unique to your situation, however 
there is normally no tax to be paid  if:
● The value of your estate is below of £325,000 - this is known as the Nil Rate Band (NRB) 
● You leave everything above the threshold to your spouse or civil partner, or 
● You leave everything above the threshold to an exempt beneﬁciary such as a charity 
If this is correct for you loved one’s estate - you still need to report this to HMRC. You can do this here: Valuing the estate of  
someone who's died: Report the estate's value to HMRC . Then, you can skip to Probate Step 5. 
If the estate is valued at over £325,000, there is usually tax to pay  on anything over this threshold at a rate of 40%. 
However, there are many exceptions to this. For more information, follow this link to the government website: Inheritance  
Tax - GOV.UK How do I know if I need to pay it? 
LoA Step 3:  do I need to pay Inheritance Tax? 

● Sometimes banks or building societies will release 
money out of your loved ones account before probate 
has been issued, if it is being used to pay IHT directly 
to HMRC. 
● if you are paying IHT on property, HMRC may accept 
staged payments so you can pay back IHT over a 
longer time frame. 
● If you pay for IHT out of your money, you can get a 
refund from the estate when probate is granted. 
1) Value your loved ones estate - Steps 1 and 2 
2) Decide whether it is likely that you will need to 
pay any Inheritance Tax based on the 
information in Step 3. 
3) Report the estimated value of the estate to 
HMRC (even if you will not need to pay 
Inheritance Tax): Valuing the estate of someone  
who's died: Report the estate's value to HMRC 
4) If you think you need to pay IHT, apply for a 
reference number (this needs to happen 3 
weeks before you make a payment): Pay your  
Inheritance Tax bill: Get a payment reference  
number  
5) Pay your inheritance tax: Pay your Inheritance  
Tax bill - GOV.UK 
Where do I get the money to pay 
Inheritance Tax? 
● Inheritance Tax (IHT) must be paid by the end of the 
sixth month after the person’s death. 
● HMRC will start charging interest on any unpaid tax 
after the 6-month period, so you should begin even if 
you haven’t valued the estate fully. 
● If you pay too much or little, it will be corrected after 
you receive probate (this is called payment on 
account). When do I need to pay it? How to pay Inheritance Tax: 
LoA Step 4:  paying your Inheritance Tax 

What do I need? 
Before you begin the Probate form 
you will need to gather the following: 
● The original will 
● The original death certiﬁcate or 
an interim death certiﬁcate from 
the coroner 
● A completed estimation and 
report of the value of the estate 
from HMRC, as completed in 
Step 1 and 2. 
● A notice from HMRC saying that 
you’ve either paid inheritance 
tax or have no tax to pay, as 
completed in Step 3 or 4 . 
○ This can be corrected 
if necessary after the 
Probate application is 
completed 
Ready to apply? The application fee is £215 if the value of the estate is £5,000 or over. There’s 
no application fee if the estate is under £5,000. 
Extra copies of the Letter of Administration cost £1.50 each. It is worth getting 
a few copies - we would recommend one for each account you still have to 
close, so you are able to send them to different organisations at the same 
time. This should help you to complete the process faster. 
Once you have gathered all the documents from the list on the left, you need to 
complete the PA1P form. You can check whether you are eligible to apply for a 
Grant of Probate online here.  Please note, Letter of Administration follows the 
same steps as applying for Probate, hence why the link takes you to the  GOV 
website page titled ‘Apply for Probate’. 
If you are not eligible, you will need to submit the forms via post. You can ﬁnd 
the PA1P form here: Form PA1P: Apply for probate by post if there is a will 
Things to note: 
LoA Step 5:  it’s time to apply for Letter of Administration 

● A Letter of Administration usually takes around 4 weeks to be granted, but may take longer at the moment 
due to coronavirus. 
● You may have already contacted ﬁnancial organisations to inform them of your loved one’s death, and the 
accounts should be frozen to stop payments going in or out of the account. You can now contact your loved 
one’s ﬁnancial account providers to inform them that you now h ave a Letter of Administration on to act on 
their behalf. 
● Once you are able to access their accounts, this means you can now make a correct assessment of the value 
of their estate. If you have over or underpaid Inheritance Tax with HMRC, you can now correct this. If you are 
doing this without a solicitor, you can ﬁnd information on how to do that here: Pay your Inheritance Tax bill:  
Pay early to avoid paying interest 
● Depending on the ﬁnancial situation your loved one was in, you can now pay off any debts from the estate. 
The next task is to distribute their assets according to the rules of intestacy. You can ﬁnd more information 
and advice around how to do that here: Intestacy - who inherits if someone dies without a will?
